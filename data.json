He was an artistic photographer who also made portraits and technical photographs. On 28 July 1912, Halberstadt became engaged to the daughter of Sigmund and Martha Freud, Sophie. They married in Hamburg on 14 January 1913. Their first child, Ernst Wolfgang, was born on 11 March 1914. He was the child Sigmund Freud observed playing \u201cFort-da\u201d with a cotton reel and wrote about in a chapter in \u2018Beyond the Pleasure Principle\u2019. They had another son, named Heinz, born in Schwerin in 1918. Halberstadt photographed his father-in-law and the portrait of Freud holding his cigar has become iconic. His earliest portrait of Freud was published with the article \u201cDer Sch\u00f6pfer der Neuen Seelenkunde (Professor Sigmund Freud)\u201d by Theodor Reik in 1914. As well as being a respected portrait photographer, Halberstadt was one of the founding members of the Gesellschaft Deutscher Lichtbildner. In 1920, Sophie\u2019s life was tragically cut short due to the interwar influenza epidemic. She was 26 when she died. Three years later Heinz died from tuberculosis. In 1923, Halberstadt married a woman called Berta. In 1936, Halberstadt emigrated to South Africa to escape the increasing persecution of the National Socialists. He died in Johannesburg on 30 December 1940.",

        "Description": "\nAdministrative history: Neville Fraser is the only child of Max Freizeit and Minnie Freizeit (nee Zimment). Max and Minnie Freizeit were married on August 25th 1925 at the Roumanian Synagogue, Ramsgate Street, Broughton, Max Freizeit took a shop at 65, Bury New Road which he ran as a woollen merchant's business. Max Freizeit was born Maksas Freiceitas (Frajcajt in Polish) in Augustowa, Poland, on January 16th 1893. In 1920 he spent some time in Berlin where he stayed at Kantor A. Frommermann's Hotel. He came to England in September 1920 as a student. In England he adopted the surname Freizeit. His son Neville adopted the present family surname - Fraser. Max Freizeit was naturalised in 1933. Max Freizeit's (Markas Freiceitas') parents were Abraham Nissan Freiceitas and Chava Freiceitas (nee Morris). At the time of their son, Markas' birth, they were living at the Market Place, Augustowa. Abraham Nissan Freiceitas had a brother, Yankel Moshe, living in Augustowa (written Augustow in Polish). Yankel Moshe's son, Chanan, left Poland after World War One and settled in Palestine. He had a son, Benjamin, who lives in Herzilia. Besides their son Markas, Abraham and Chava Freiceitas also had a son Samuel. He settled in London where he ran a butcher's business. Samuel married Sarah Herman on November 4th 1925 at Grove Street Synagogue. Samuel adopted the surname Fraser. Samuel and Sarah had 2 children, David and Ruth (now Mrs Aitman). Sophie, daughter of Abraham and Chava Freiceitas, came to England and she married Alter Silvert, a grocer. Their children were Philip, Jack, Sydney, Jean, Hymie and Regina (known as Sadie). Rosie, daughter of Abraham and Chava Freiceitas, married a Mr. Goldstein, an upholsterer, and they settled in Manchester. They had the following children: Freda (married name - Cohen), Rae (married name - Refson), Cyril, Jack, Beattrice (married name - Druce), Arthur and Sydney (known as Hymie). Abraham and Chava's daughter, Leah, married Mr. Goldman of London - he was a butcher and property owner. They had the following children: Philip (known as Hymie), Sadie (married name - Moss), Anne (married name - Trop) and Rae (married name - Meltzer). Leah went back to Poland to see her family there. She went with Louis Freedman, her nephew. Neville Fraser put the date of this visit as c1930. Leah was the eldest of the Freiceitas children. Abraham and Chava's daughter, Yetta, married Morris Freedman of London. Their children were Ann (married name - Sheer), Louis, Rae (married name - Baker) and Sophie (married name - Ashmed). Chava Freiceitas had a brother, Hyman Morris, in Belfast. He lived at 10 Brookvale Avenue, Antrim Road, and was by trade a general draper and furniture dealer. Chava's sister Leah and brothers Sam and Solomon also settled in Belfast. Abraham Nissan Freiceitas went to Belfast once on a visit. The Freiceitas family in Augustowa were murdered in the Holocaust. Neville Fraser's mother, Minnie, was born Mindla Zimment in Kolbinzowa, Galicia, in 1899. The spelling of the surname varies - in England they appear to have spelled it Ziment or Siment. Minnie (Mindla) was one of 4 children. Her sister, Malcher, married Abraham Pfeffer. They lived in Manchester. Her brother, Harry, married Nancy. They had 5 children: Shirley (married name - Freedman), Dr. Irwin Ziment, now of Los Angeles, Neil Sinclair (he changed his surname from Ziment) a lawyer in London, Linda (married name - Glynn) who married a Leeds clothing manufacturer, and John Ziment who, along with his mother, Nancy, now lives in Marabella. Ann Ziment (sister of Mindla, Harry and Malcher) married a Mr Watchtell. They had 2 boys - Saul and Nathan. Nathan has adopted the surname Wallace. The parents of Mindla, Malcher, Ann and Harry Ziment were Chaya and Isaac Ziment, both of whom were born in Kolbinzowa in 1867. Isaac Ziment was a merchant. Chaya Ziment is recorded as having arrived in the U.K. in 1913 (recorded on an Aliens Order Certificate). During World War Two Chaya Ziment was living in Buxton for a while and Neville Fraser went to live there too. Chaya Ziment had a sister, Ethel, who married a Mr Fuher. They had 4 children: Rowena, Molly, Anna and Shirley. They all lived in New York. Isaac Ziment had a sister called Fremit. She married Mendel Feingold, a Manchester grocer.",

Her father, Jack Hart, was one of four children of John Hart, died 1913, the Manager of Taylor & Nicholson's Mill, a Bleach works near Mather Road in Bury. The Mill went out of business before the War and during the War, was used a food store. Mrs Blythe's paternal grandmother was Frances Hart, from Egerton, whose maiden name was Strong. She had married before, but her first married name is unknown. Her daughter from this first marriage was the depositor's aunt Maude, who married Jack Greenhalgh, but had no children. The children of her marriage to Jack Hart were, Hilda, who married Harry Haworth, but had no children, Jack, depositor's father, and Fred, who married Florence and had four daughters and a son. Mrs Blythe's mother was born Alice Harrison, only child of Albert Harrison and his wife Ada n\u00e9e Capstick, who appear many times in Mrs Hart's snapshot Album. She had been given her first camera in about 1926; it was a box Brownie costing 10/6. Albert Harrison's mother, Sarah Harrison n\u00e9e Robinson, died a fortnight after her son was born, so Albert was brought up by his grandmother, Elizabeth Robinson, whose husband was a blacksmith in Bury. Albert's mother was the youngest of four children: John, married Annie Chadwick who had four children and died in childbirth. John never remarried and went back to live with his mother. Mary Ann and Arthur were the other two children of Elizabeth Robinson. Albert Harrison came to Bury from Burnley in the early 1920's and was Company Secretary to A. Worsley & Sons Ltd. The Company owned five mills, all cotton waste Mills, three in Bury, two in Haslingden. In Bury, they were: Chesham, a spinning mill, Moorside, a spinning and weaving mill and Fountain Street, also a spinning and weaving mill and still in existence. In Haslingden, they were: Plantation Mill and Duckworth Clough. This last is said to be the highest Mill in the country and is still in existence. Mrs Blythe's maternal grandmother was Ada Capstick, originally from Burnley, born 1887, married Albert Harrison about 1910. Ada was one of four girls, daughters of William and Alice Capstick, who came from Todmorden: Susanna, known as 'Sissie', was the eldest, she married Jim Jackson, Annie, who died unmarried aged 41, Esther, known as 'Ettie', and Ada.",

Frederick and Margaret Wallis had 4 children - Henry James - donor (born 1910), Celia (born ), Winifred (born ) and Alexander (born ). Mr. Wallis's grandparents. Henry James Wallis - born 1856. Died 22nd Oct 1923. Henry James Wallis was married twice. First wife - Martha Mitchell - born ? Married in 1873. Henry James and Martha Wallis had 3 children, (George, Fred and Charles). Second wife - Alice Mathison - born 1865. Married 25th Aug 1887 in Glasgow. Henry James and Alice had 4 children, (Jimmy, Albert, Etty and Beatty). Mr. Wallis's great grandparents. Henry James Wallis - born ? Anne Morgan - born ? All references to Mr. Wallis refer to the donor. Mr. Wallis's great grandfather made fishing tackle in London and in the 1850's came to Liverpool. His grandfather is named as a 'travelling photographer' but he also used to have either a shop or a studio. Mr. Wallis remembers being told his grandfather took photographs of dead babies as a record for their families. He started taking sites on street fairs, where he used an 'aptus' ? camera which produced 'instant' prints for his customers. He got his photographic supplies from 'Moores' in Daler Street, Liverpool. It was through this work that the Wallis family came to work on the fairgrounds. Mr. Wallis's grandfather worked on the travelling cinematographic shows. He made his own picture shows but also hired. He lived in Church Road, Seaforth, outside which there is his wedding photograph. Mr. Wallis's grandfather and father had various fairground pieces at different times (these included roundabouts, swings, switchbacks, joywheels etc.) During the first World War Mr. Wallis's father worked as a steward and his mother ran a sweet shop. They then lived at 5 Balfe Street in Seaforth but before the First World War moved to 25 Scott Street in Bootle and lived there for 25 years. The Wallis's operated in the Lancashire area which meant they would always return home between fairs, at weekends and whenever they could. After the war Mr. Wallis's father returned to work on the fairgrounds. He also had side stalls which were often run by his wife while he ran the principle pieces. Fair sites were run by individuals who then rented off space to showmen. Mr. Wallis's father, having himself such principle pieces as roundabouts, would sometimes run a site. Advertisements announcing forthcoming fairs and details of available space etc. can be seen in the showman's newspaper, 'The World's Fair'. Mr. Wallis's father worked together with his brother, George. Mr. Wallis's father was greatly interested in traction engines and very mechanically minded, being able to fix anything. Traction engine owners were considered the 'upper crust' amongst showpeople as they were expensive items and essential if one ran any principal piece. Mr. Wallis went to St. James School, Bootle. As a child he remembers helping around the fairground and as he grew older worked with his father. He married Dorothy Martin in 1936, whose mother and grandfather were also involved in the fairground business. During the Second World War he worked for Chadburns on the Liverpool Docks fitting out ships. After the war he returned to his work as a travelling showman but mainly ran side stalls such as hoopla, roll-a-penny, coconut shys, fish and globes etc. Mr. Wallis is still working in the business as is his son, and they work in the Greater Manchester area.",

During her early years she suffered badly from asthma and so rarely attended school. Her father, John William Wilkinson, was a postman and so considered to have a steady job. He was earning 27/- a week in 1916 when the rent was 6/- per week. He had one brother and three sisters. The donor's mother, Selina Ann Morley (b.1873) had been apprenticed to Kendal Milnes to learn millinery (she had to pay for this apprenticeship) and was later a bookbinder at John Heywoods (printers) of Manchester. She was also the woman who dealt with deaths, illnesses confinements etc. in the street. The donor's maternal grandfather was a craftsman and ran his own business, working in wrought iron. He made the main gates at Alexandra Park. The donor's maternal grandmother originally came from Macclesfield. Her father gave up his inheritance in the silk mills and became a preacher. Grandmother Wilkinson was left a widow and took a sweet shop in Medlock Street. The parents of the donor married in 1900 and moved into a new house in Crystal Street, Hulme, behind Rowlands Bakery, then later into Chorlton Road, Whalley Range. Her father bought a house in Old Trafford (Duke Street) then another two nearby. All 3 were destroyed during the 1940 blitz when her parents were also injured. One of these houses destroyed in Cornbrook Grove, Old Trafford, was then the home of the donor and her family and she too was injured. The donor met her husband, Reg. Weeks in 1925, was engaged in 1926 and married him in 1927. They married at St. Margarets Church, Whalley Range. They spent their honeymoon in Ilfracombe and Bath (husband's grandmother lived here and they spent 3 days with her). They had one son, Norman William Weeks, who was born in 1929. After their marriage they lived at 157 Chorlton Road, with the donor's father-in-law, then moved to Cornbrook Grove, and after its destruction to their present address. The donor had worked for 11 years after school, as a shipping clerk in the cotton trade (she started at 6/- a week and ended at \u00a32.10s.0d a week), then she went to work at a paper manufacturers and by 1934 she had become the only female waste-paper buyer in the country. She left and worked later at Lewis' and at John Nobles' Mail Order firm in Princess St, Manchester. Her husband Reg was an underbuyer for a Belgian cotton firm in Granby Row, Manchester, which closed down in 1930. For 4 years Reg had no work and lived on 25/- a week dole (including a 1/- allowance for their son, Norman). To make ends meet the donor made and sold jam and cakes to people, for instance, the Stretford Wheelers' Club who met locally every Monday. She also went to nightschool to learn dressmaking. She remembers everyone fighting to get a lodger and she got one, a policeman, who paid 25/- a week, all in. Later she took in her cousin Marion, who had been deserted by her husband. She paid 2/6 a week because she only earned 11/- a week at the C.W.S. diningroom of which some had to go to support a child in Rochdale. The donor remembers they lived a lot on fishcakes at this time. The donor's father-in-law had been a master-joiner and was also made redundant (with 3 grown sons to support, all unemployed).",

        "Title": "PHOTOGRAPHS RELATED TO FLORENCE MARY WOOLMER",
        "Description": "\nAdministrative history: This deposit consists of three Albums belonging to depositor's great-aunt on her mother's side Florence Mary Woolmer. They came into the possession of the depositor's family when Florence died, c. 1978. She was born in 1888, the daughter of Rev Wesley Woolmer, a Methodist Minister and his wife, Amelia Ann, nee Beaumont. She was sent to school near Bristol with her elder sister, Margaret, and later took a degree in English at Bedford College, London University. She became a teacher and is known to have taught at schools in Luton and Margate. After she retired, she lived in Hastings and latterly in New Romney in Kent. The depositor's family used to visit her in these two places. See attached sheet. Reverend Wesley Woolmer was born at Kingswood School, the Methodist Boys' School at Charlcombe near Bath on 25 March 1858 to Rev Theophilus Woolmer and his wife Myra Field n\u00e9e Oliver. He was the first child to be born to a resident Governor at the School, which was his father's occupation at the time. As yet, little is known about his education, although it seems likely that he attended Kingswood School himself, as did his father and his own sons. He became a Methodist Minister in the early 1880's and the following is a list of his Circuits : Sevenoaks, Plumstead, Lambeth, St Helens, Sandown, I. O. W., c. 1895 - 1898 ? Oxenhope, Keighley, St Leonards, Walthamstow, Luton, St Albans, Woolwich, Margate, Northampton, Ealing. On 13 October 1885, he married Amelia Ann Beaumont at the Cliftonville Chapel, Margate, the ceremony being performed by his father. For details of his wife and her family, see deposit 1381. Their six children were: Margaret Amelia, born 1886 ?at Sevenoaks, who was sent away to school with her sister Florence to Weston-super-Mare. She later became a Froebel-trained Infants Mistress and married Rev Harold Jolly on 4 January 1917, a distant relative. They had three children, two of whom are married with families, the third died in infancy. Margaret died in 1979, outliving her husband by 11 years. Florence Mary, born 1888. She took a degree in English at Bedford College, London University before the First World War, and taught as an English Mistress at various schools until she retired. She never married and died in 1975. Shirley Beaumont. All that is known about him so far is that he was the Manager of a Hat Factory in Luton; his mother had set him up in the business when she came into money. He died in 1955, leaving one son who is married with no children. Frederick Charles, he became a Bank Manager, was married with three children and died in 1968. Geoffrey Challenor, born January 1895. He went to Kingswood School, which he hated. He had a farm bought for him by his mother, but after being injured in the First World War, had to give it up and became a Sales Representative for Cheeseborough-Ponds. He was married and has three children and lives in Stoke d'Abernon in Surrey. Ellen Beatrice, born 4 February 1897 at Sandown on the Isle of Wight. She was sent to Queenswood School, the Girls counterpart of Kingswood; at the time she attended, it was situated at Clapham. She absolutely loathed the place and despite all entreaties to take her away, her mother kept her there; she was very friendly with the Head Mistress, Miss Trew. After leaving school, she trained as a Teacher of Physical Education at Chelsea College and afterwards taught at several schools. After her older sister Margaret's wedding on 4 January 1917, she met 2nd Lieutenant John Newton Hudson who had come to lodge with the family while training with the Royal Horse Artillery, and they fell in love. Her mother strongly disapproved of the match, but they eventually married on 21 March 1921 at the Wesleyan Chapel at Warwick Gardens, Kensington. They had one daughter, the Field Officer's mother. For details of John Hudson's family, see deposit 1319. Ellen died on 11 May 1944, after having suffered a stroke the previous year. Wesley Woolmer and his wife lived at 45, Culmington Road, Ealing after his retirement. He died on 13 January 1937 at King Edward's Hospital after a street accident. The Field Officer's mother remembers him as a quiet, gentle man, perhaps rather henpecked by his domineering, matriarchal wife; he had his own shed at the bottom of the garden as his retreat. He had perfect pitch and sang in a choir for years being very musical. His perfect pitch also helped him to tell the difference between the engines of English and German planes when they flew over during the First World War!",

Her father, born 1879, came originally from Avon Dassett in Oxfordshire. After leaving school, he became a groom/coachman for a family outside Maidenhead, where he met Lottie Savery, who was also employed there as a parlour maid. After marrying in 1903 the couple moved to Banbury, Thomas working as groom for a local doctor. After service in the Royal Veterinary Corps in World War I, the donor's father returned to his previous employment. Lottie Savery died in 1927, at the age of 46. The donor kept house for her father, until the death of his employer soon afterwards in 1928. Thomas then went to work at Steadham Hll in Sussex, announcing that the donor could go to Leicester to live with his sister, in fact she lived with a cousin and her husband, who found her employment in the printing firm where he worked. Here she met her future husband, Walter Payne, who was also a printer. Walter was one of 6 children, 3 girls and 3 boys. His father was an engineer in the boot and shoe industry in Leicester. From Leicester, Walter moved to Trafford Park to work for Norbury, Natzio and Co., Ltd, a printing firm. The couple lived nearby in Elsinore Road, eventually moving to Timperley.

        "Title": "FAMILY PHOTOGRAPHS RELATING TO MRS E. IRELAND",
        "Description": "\nAdministrative history: The Symes family Elizabeth Terrell, the donor's maternal grandmother, came from Martock near Yeovil. She left Yeovil in search of work and came to Manchester to take up employment as a cook in a gentleman's house. She was followed by other members of the Terrell family - Charles, Jane, Joe and Jim. Elizabeth married William Symes. He delivered parcels by horse and cart to Marks and Spencer, and found them their first warehouse. They had 6 children, Emma Elizabeth (known as Emmy), Phyllis, Jane (known as Jennie), twins Lily and Annie, and John William (known as Jack). The twins died in childhood aged 1 and 13. Emmy went to work for Marks and Spencer at the Oldham Street Penny Bazaar and became a manageress. Phyllis was apprenticed as a tailoress but later went to Marks and Spencer because the wages were higher. Jane went to work at Blairs corset factory but was not a good machinist and so she also went to work for Marks and Spencer in Oldham Street. Their father died about this time, aged 49. When Marks and Spencer opened another shop in Hull, Emmy went as manageress. Phyllis and Jane stayed at Oldham Street until Emmy found them a house and then the whole family moved to Holderness Road, Hull. Emmy stayed in Hull until she married J.J. Mayo who worked for the Electricity Company at Stewart Street Power Station in Bradford, Manchester and returned to Manchester. Phyllis went to work for Marks and Spencer in York and met her future husband. She went to work in Birmingham but returned to York to marry Charles Avison, a dairyman. Jane was then a manageress of a Marks and Spencer shop in Hull until she returned to Manchester to marry William Winstanley, a miner from Bradford, in 1915. They had one child, Elsie, the donor. John William was in the services during World War One. On returning to civilian life, he was introduced to the shoe trade by his uncle Charlie who was a manager of a Freeman Hardy & Willis shop in Pontefract, Yorkshire. John William eventually became manager of a Freeman, Hardy and Willis shop at County Road, Liverpool, and stayed in Liverpool until his retirement. His mother Elizabeth kept house for him after the death of her husband until he married Alice Gillings who was a cousin of Charles Avison. The Winstanley family William Winstanley, the donor's paternal grandfather, went to work at Bradford Colliery, Manchester at the age of 8. His first job was to let in a flow of air by continually opening and closing a door. He later became a coal hewer and lost an eye in a mine accident or explosion. Afterwards he worked on the pit top until his retirement. His wife Emma was an invalid for several years and died in 1921. They had 5 children, Walter, Samuel, Edward, William and Emma. The boys all worked in the pit. They became known as 'double' uns' because they often worked a double shift to pay for doctors bills for their mother. William Winstanley, the donor's father, was born in 1889. He became a member of Ancoats Lads Club in the Round House in Every Street, and he played football for the Club. The Club at that time was run by Arthur Taylor who impressed William greatly. William married Jane Symes on 23 October 1915. They had one daughter, Elsie, the donor, born in 1920. He began his working life at Bradford Colliery as his brothers did. He became secretary of the Bradford Miners Branch at the age of 23 and was victimised after the coal strike of 1923 which forced him to leave the mine. After 1923 he went as steward and secretary of Bradford Labour Club. He then became the licensee of The Holt Town Tavern, Mitchell Street (now Merrell Street), opposite the Salvation Army. He stayed there until 1929 when he was advised by his doctor to take an open air job because of his bad chest. In 1925 he bought an insurance book with the Liverpool Victoria and in those days the cost of an insurance book was 30 times its collecting value. Wages were paid on a commission and, when times were hard, this could be very low. Because of this and his wife Jane's experience of shop work, they also bought a very run down grocery shop in Stretton Street, Collyhurst. They encouraged trade by selling home made pies, potted meats etc. And when the shop was established on a good basis, they sold it in 1931. From here they moved into a private house because William's insurance book had increased. Later, however, they bought another run down shop off Bradford Road, Beswick. After building up this business they sold it and moved to 59, Ashton New Road, an empty shop. Here they opened a temperance bar selling sweets, tobaccos and patent medicines and stayed there until 1962 when William died. This could not be sold as a going concern owing to future demolition and road widening. He continued his political activity and in 1939 he was elected to the Manchester City Council, as labour councillor for the Beswick ward. He was elected Alderman in 1956. He revisited Bradford Colliery on one occasion after leaving the pit to escort the Lord Mayor on a visit. Photographs 1150/1-70 relate to the family of the donor's husband, James Ireland. They came into the donor's possession as her husband's mother came to live with her son and his wife. Ada Withington, a damask weaver, and daughter of John William Withington (see deposit 1150/6) married Harry Ireland, a cashier at Central Station. They had 3 children: Winifred, the eldest child, Mary and James who was born in 1918.",

Alice came from Tunstall in Staffordshire. She met her future husband when he was visiting his father, Charles Thomas Nixon who had left Manchester and bought a gents outfitters business in Tunstall. Catherine Nixon is the only child of Herbert Neville Birchall and Ada Kearton. The Birchall family came from Cheshire, but moved to Tunstall when the donor's paternal great-grandfather became manager of the Golden Dale Iron works there. There were 9 children in the family. One son, the donor's grandfather, Peter Birchall, married Eliza Ann Price. He was a builder and also specialised in building-up businesses, one of which was a pot-bank, used for firing teapots. His only child, Herbert, the donor's father, was made the manager of this business. Herbert's main interest was music. He was a talented organist and wished to play professionally. Soon after his marriage and the birth of the donor, a mistake in the firing at the pot-bank, resulted in a disagreement with his father. He took his family to Canada to start a career as a theatre organist. Before the outbreak of World War I, because her mother had been ill, both returned to England for a visit. The war prevented their return to Canada, although later the donor's mother managed to make the trip, leaving Catherine with her paternal grandparents. In 1920 she rejoined her parents. When her grandfather, Peter Birchall died in 1924 his wife made a six month visit to Canada. It was decided that Catherine should return to England to live with her for a short time. To extend his career, the donor's father moved to the U.S.A. where he died suddenly in 1927. Her mother returned to Tunstall and she too died in 1933. Catherine's family and her husband's family are inter-related. John Nixon was an accountant. Their only child, Neville Nixon is also an accountant in Stockport.",

        "Description": "\nAdministrative history: The depositor's father Emmanuel Nove was born in Pottava province in the Ukraine in 1871. The original family name was Novakovsky, literally 'the new man in the city'. In 1889 the young Emmanuel Nove deserted from the Russian army to which he had been forcibly conscripted, eloped with his young bride Betsy and left Russia for Britain. He went first to Wrexham in North Wales where his eldest child Jenny and her brother Samuel were born. For four or five years he worked as a house-painter in this small Welsh market town. He moved to Manchester in the 1890s, settling first on Wilmslow Road, Fallowfield at the Southern end of the horse-drawn tramways from the city. There his third child Lily was born. Setting up a small firm of builders Emmanuel Nove began to construct houses in the Didsbury area, his first efforrs being Grove Terrace, Burton Road, Withington (1910). He himself lived at 4 Grove Terrace where his daughter Raie, the depositor, was born. Subsequently he built Old Broadway in Withington, moving there with his famioy in about 1916. At that time the suburbanisation of Didsbury and Withington was still in progress. There were 3 farms within close walking distance of Old Broadway. Later he built 'The Circuit' in Withington. During the 1920s and early 1930s he extended into the building of cinemas and dance halls, his constructions including what is now studios 1-4 on Oxford Road near the city centre. His business suffered from the Depression however and at the time of his death in 1934 it had crashed. Nove was an indefatigable communal worker, involved in many local charitable enterprises, but his main achivement lay in the foundation and early development of the Home for the Aged and Temporary Shelter. This institution was the forerunner of Heathlands, the present Jewish Home for the Aged in Prestwich. Emmanuel Nove died on May 13th, 1934 aged 63.",

        "Description": "\nAdministrative history: The donor's maternal grandfather, Charles Buckley France, was born in Major Street off Princess Street. His family worked in textiles but 'his hands were too rough' and he worked at Dunlop Rubber in Cambridge Street, Chorlton-on-Medlock. In 1877 he married Ann Taylor. She died in 1890 and in the same year he married Sophia Taylor (unrelated). Charles France moved to 108 Renshaw Street, Hulme on his first marriage and later to Nelson Street in Rusholme. There were two children of the first marriage: Charles France Junior and Jessie (1888-1961). There was one child of the second marriage, John France; and Charles and Sophia looked after without officially adopting, Stephen Rhodes (born c.1900) who had been abandoned as a baby. Charles France Senior started work on Platt Fields in c.1895. His daughter brought him his lunch on the way to Platt School at Grove Street off Platt Lane. Around 1895 the France family moved to the Old School House, Platt Lane, and then to Rusholme Lodge Cottage, Old Hall Lane (the Old School House had been demolished before 1910). From the cottage, Mr. France ran a haulage business - at one time he had three horses. Jessie France 'became the woman of the house' when her stepmother Sophia died in c.1898. Jessie's father was completely illiterate and Jessie read the papers to him. Accounts of the Boer War upset her; he told her to stop crying. The cottage was lit by oil-lamp. The donor's paternal grandfather was in the army all his life. His five children were born in five different places because of Army movements. They were: Kit, Alice, Lilly, Hugh, and Winnie. Hugh was put into the army as a boy. Matthew Hugh Davins, the donor's father, was small and worked as a groom to officers' horses. He went to South Africa shortly after the Boer War, and then to Mauritius where he obtained a Mauritus Jockey Club licence and rode for a Captain Fairlie. This officer resigned and 'Darkie' Davins bought himself out to ride for him. After the donor's father had spent some time at a French racing stables, the officer's money ran out and the scheme folded. Hugh Davins then worked as chauffeur to another officer until he returned to Manchester and worked as a ticket inspector on the trams in c.1912. He met Jessie France while staying with his parents at 13 Sherlock Street, Fallowfield. In 1914 he volunteered for transport duty and was sent to France with the British Expeditionary Force. Because he had learnt French while in Mauritus his duties included looking for billets. He and Jessie France married in 1918.",

She had 2 older sisters, Maud and Dorothy and a younger brother, Frank, all of whom are now dead. Her mother, Maud Emily Stones was brought up by her maternal grandfather, David Dickens. Her own mother Hannah Stones died in 1877 at the age of 24, when she was 2 years old. Her father was younger than his wife and as he was unable to care for her, he left her with his father-in-law in Failsworth and disappeared. Her grandfather, a widower was a remarkable man, not only did he bring up Maud but also the 4 children of his son, Henry Dickens. Henry worked in Russia as a mill manager. His wife Sophia was with him, but each time she was pregnant she returned to England to have the child, left it with her father-in-law to look after, and went back to Russia. Maud went to school with her four cousins, Matthew, Mary Annie and Alfred, where they were known as 'the Russian bears' because of the fur coats they wore in winter. The donor's mother left school at 11, to work in a Failsworth mill. When she was 17 her father reappeared to claim her. He had remarried had a young family and had decided that Maud's wages would be a useful supplement to the family income. She first heard of her father's reappearance when she was given a message by her foreman at work to let her know that he was waiting for her outside. Not wishing to face him, she left by another gate and ran home to her grandfather who was ready to confront him when he turned up on the doorstep. Her father left the area in a hurry and she never saw him again. She was nicknamed by the neighbours 'Little Nell' because the circumstances of her upbringing so closely resembled the Dickens character. In 1901 Maud married John Henry Cobbold at St. Andrews Church in Oldham. John's father was dead and his mother had raised his 2 sisters and 6 brothers. He was the manager of Tetlows Grocery Shop in Manchester Street, Oldham, but moved soon after his marriage to Beswick in Manchester, where he opened a grocery business of his own. In 1912 he sold the shop and became caretaker of St. Philip's school in Bradford and later Smedley Road School, in Cheetham, he remained there until he died in 1935. The donor married in 1947.

John Henry Hodson was one of five brothers, the others being : Edward, Joseph, William and Frederick. He also had 3 sisters: Minnie, Maggie and Ada. Ada married Edward Barber. Maggie married John Erskine and had one daughter, Mabel. Minnie married Joseph Barber (Edward and Joseph were brothers). Their father was a partner in a firm called 'Hodson and Waddington' a furniture manufacturers and removal firm. John Henry Hodson went into his father's business. John and Clare Hodson had two children, Dorothy (donor) and John Cyril. Dorothy Harrop's maternal grandfather was called Tom Kirkpatrick. He was a qualified dentist and lived in a three story Victorian house on New Bridge Street. The ground floor was kitchen etc., the first floor his surgery, and the top floor living accommodation. The house was on land belonging to Boddington's Brewery and after the 99 year lease expired became their property. Tom Kirkpatrick was then a tenant. Tom and Eleanor Kirkpatrick had four children: Claire (donor's mother) - married John Henry Hodson and had two children. Worked as a teacher before her marriage. May - married Cressy Milne, an industrial chemist who worked for Levenstein's (now I.C.I.). May married when young and they moved away from Manchester to Kent. Minnie - a teacher, she was bi-lingual in German, travelled a great deal, and never married. Tom - the youngest, became a photographer. (See below). He married and had one son, Tom (donor's cousin).

A number of photographs in Mrs. Harrop's collection give this as his address but there are also a number which give New Bridge Street, which is where his father lived and practised as a dentist. He is thought to have worked as a photographer from c.1890. During the 1914/18 war he worked for the Manchester Guardian and after the war is thought to have been one of the first to take aerial photographs of Manchester. He then worked as a dentist for a short time in Chorlton, although having no official training he must have learnt a good deal from his father.

He was an artistic photographer who also made portraits and technical photographs. On 28 July 1912, Halberstadt became engaged to the daughter of Sigmund and Martha Freud, Sophie. They married in Hamburg on 14 January 1913. Their first child, Ernst Wolfgang, was born on 11 March 1914. He was the child Sigmund Freud observed playing \u201cFort-da\u201d with a cotton reel and wrote about in a chapter in \u2018Beyond the Pleasure Principle\u2019. They had another son, named Heinz, born in Schwerin in 1918. Halberstadt photographed his father-in-law and the portrait of Freud holding his cigar has become iconic. His earliest portrait of Freud was published with the article \u201cDer Sch\u00f6pfer der Neuen Seelenkunde (Professor Sigmund Freud)\u201d by Theodor Reik in 1914. As well as being a respected portrait photographer, Halberstadt was one of the founding members of the Gesellschaft Deutscher Lichtbildner. In 1920, Sophie\u2019s life was tragically cut short due to the interwar influenza epidemic. She was 26 when she died. Three years later Heinz died from tuberculosis. In 1923, Halberstadt married a woman called Berta. In 1936, Halberstadt emigrated to South Africa to escape the increasing persecution of the National Socialists.

        "Description": "\nAdministrative history: The donor's parents were George William Merrison and Amy Elizabeth Hoyle. George was born in 1865 and came from Great Yarmouth. After leaving school, he ran away from home, changed his surname to Mason and joined the Royal Marines. He was known by that name until his marriage when the necessity to produce a birth certificate forced him to reveal the truth. He remained in the Marines for 20 years, much of the time being based at the China Station. He watched Shanghai develop from a mud flat into a city and when its police force was established, he left the Marines and became a policeman. Amy Hoyle was born in 1869 in Todmorden, the eldest of the 14 children of Edward and Emily Hoyle. Edward was a cabinet and violin maker. Amy was a trained and dedicated nurse. In 1903 at the age of 34, she was appointed as the matron of the British Nursing Home in Bangkok on a 3 year contract. On the voyage out, she met George Mason who was returning from leave. He proposed, Amy refused, she had a contract to honour and she was very undecided about marriage. They corresponded for 3 years. In 1906 Amy left Bangkok, to return home via Shanghai. The couple met again and on this occasion she accepted. They were married in Shanghai Cathedral. The donor, their only child, was born in 1911. They were in Shanghai when World War I broke out. All home leave was suspended during the war years and it was not until 1920 that George was given an extended one of 9 months. In 1923 George died of diabetes. Amy had 1 month to pack and leave Shanghai. Back in England, she sent Irene to a boarding school in Windermere and took up nursing again. Later she opened a business in Manchester. Irene completed her education with a secretarial course at Loreburn College, after which she obtained employment in the Civil Service. In 1929, she married Arthur Taylor, a clerk. Their first home was in Withington and then the present house in Davyhulme. They had 2 children, a son who lives permanently in Australia and a daughter. Amy died in 1954, aged 85 and Arthur in 1981, aged 81.",

        "Title": "PHOTOGRAPHS RELATED TO THE FAMILY OF ALAN MORRISON",
        "Description": "\nAdministrative history: The donor's great-grandmother Mary Thornley (born 28 December 1851), daughter of Alpheus and Eliza, nee Cooper, married Naphthaly Hirsch Levy on 31 May 1871. They went to live at 41, Lyme Street, Chorlton on Medlock. Naphthaly had his own business with offices at 18, Old Corn Exchange, Manchester. In the 1871 Census he is living at 40, Booth Street East, Hulme, as a lodger. Naphthaly was an importer of potatoes and olive oil (sumach and farina) until 1876 when a potato blight hit Ireland. Naphthaly invested money in the import of potatoes from Spain, transporting them down the Irwell. The Authorities, however, would not allow him to land these potatoes, thinking they came from Ireland. On the verge of bankruptcy Naphthaly went to his father-in-law, Alpheus Thornley and persuaded him to take a property at 3, Holly Bank, Chester Road, Stretford and the two families moved in together. References to the business in the Corn Exchange cease. According to family tradition Naphthaly told Mary to get their furniture around to her mother's in order to safeguard it from the bailiffs. Naphthaly then left for America. By this time they had one son, Harry. Naphthaly found work with a brewer called Franks in Cincinnati. Mary went over to visit him in America about 18 months after his departure, had another child, Oliver (who died after a few months) and became very ill. She returned to England to recover. The 1881 Census records her living at 6, Temperance Vine, Chapel Lane, Stretford with Alpheus and Eliza Thornley, and her son, Harry. Mary returned to America a second time and had a third child, Marion who also died after a few months. After Mary's return to England, Naphthaly moved to Baltimore to wok for a cotton millionaire called Douglas as his personal secretary. Naphthaly apparently could read and write 5 languages. Mary is known to have established an off licence business in America. They had another son, Lawrence, born 30 July 1887. Harry died in the States aged 16 or 17. By the 30 July 1889 Naphthaly Hirsch Levy had changed his name to James Morrison and the family name has become Morrison. In 1892 James Morrison became a naturalised citizen of the U.S.A. He died in 1902. Mary was in England at the time with Lawrence. She went to America to sort out the estate but for some reason was unable to claim the insurance. She sold the off licence and returned to England for good. Lawrence Morrison lived virtually with his grandfather Alpheus Thornley at 52, Urmston Lane, Stretford, while his mother was sorting out the estate in America. He became a motor mechanic. He is said to have owned the first private garage in Stretford. On 12 April 1913 Lawrence married Edith Annie Smith. She was a sales assistant for the Co-op in Downing Street.

He married Elizabeth Wood Wright who was originally from Grassington. She was a woman of strong character, often sticking up for her children against outsiders. At Armitage Street School in Ardwick she once chased a teacher round the school for keeping her son in at dinner. 55 years later the donor taught in the same classroom-but did not tell the story! During the depression Elizabeth Lister often took a rolling-pin to drunken and violent husbands. As her own husband was reasonably secure in his job she cobbled on a last in the hall of 13 Walmer Place, Longsight, for neighbours, free of charge. Ben and Elizabeth had 8 children: James born c. 1892. He entered the printing trade but soon had great difficulty getting a job - he had been blacklisted as a union militant. He emigrated to Australia, ran a dairy produce business, and at one time was the Mayor of Melbourne. Olive born c. 1893. A nurse in Hayfield. Annie born c. 1894. Wilfred born c. 1895. Killed in WW1.

Miss Walmsley donated her collection to the Manchester & Lancashire Family History Society. The Society, via Mr Snowdon its vice-chair, has deposited the photographs on indefinite loan with the D.P.A. Mr Snowdon compiled the family tree from documents and certificates which were also donated to the Society by Miss Walmsley. These documents remain in the keeping of the Manchester & Lancashire FHS. The Rev. William Vernon Walmsley was born on 16 February 1886. He was educated at Manchester Grammar School. He originally entered banking and worked in that field for seven years. He then changed careers. His own family were strict Methodists and he was the first to join the Church of England. He attended Hatfield Hall, University of Durham from where he graduated with a B.A. in 1912 and an M.A. in 1916. He was Deaconed in 1912, and Priested at York Minster in 1913. He was curate at St John, Park, Sheffield from 1912 to 1915, at Attercliffe, 1915 to 1917; Emmanuel Church, Southport, 1917 to 1925. He was vicar at St Chad's, Everton from 1925 to 1928; St John's, Crossens, Southport from 1928 to 1939; St Paul's, Southport from 1939 to 1949; and rector of St Mary de Ballaugh, Isle of Man from 1949 to 1959. He was assistant chaplain to Liverpool Cathedral from 1932 to 1949; a member of the College of Interpreters, School of Cantors and College of Marshalls at Liverpool Cathedral. He died on 17 December 1968. The donor's mother, Edith Elizabeth West, was the second child of Corinda Dight Almond and John Edward West. John Edward West worked as the estate manager for the Blankney Estate, serving the Chaplin family until the 1920s and subsequently the Earl of Londesborough who bought the estate. The Wests had eight children: John (died aged 10); Elizabeth Edith; Gertrude; Richard Pengelly Almond West (became a banker working at the head office of the Midland Bank); Alice; Charles Hugh (married Lilian Ethel Claridge and had one son Michael, Charles died in Cambridge in 1953 or 1956); Dorothy; Mabel (died aged a few weeks). Elizabeth Edith was born in 1882. Together with her sister Gertrude who was a year younger, she attended Lincoln Training College from 1904 to 1906 to train as a teacher. She then went to Sheffield to work as a teacher where she met William Vernon Walmsley. Monica Vernon Walmsley was born in 1918. She attended Southport High School. In 1942 she graduated from Durham University with a degree in Geography and Geology. The following year she secured a Diploma in Education at Oxford. She went into teaching and taught for four years but did not find the work congenial. In 1947 she took up a post as warden at Langdale Hall, Victoria Park, a hall of residence for women students at Manchester University. When her mother died in 1948 Monica spent fifteen months with her father who moved to the Isle of Man. During this period she took an M.A. Her next post was as warden of the hall of residence for female students at the Manchester College of Housecraft. Initially this was situated at Lynfield, a converted private hotel (in very poor condition) in Victoria Park. She stayed there for one year before the residence moved to Greystoke, which combined both Greystoke and Rosebank, two large houses on the junction of Palatine Road and Mersey Road. On 1 January 1957 she took up her last appointment as warden of the residences at Wythenshawe Hospital where she remained until 31 March 1984. At one time she had 350 residences in her care. On her retirement she did voluntary work for the hospital. Audrey Linkman visited Miss Walmsley on 9 May 1996 and received a further donation of photographs comprising D156/1/7; D156/3/24 - 38; D156/4/15-24; D156/5/26-42; and D156/6/56-70.",

        "Title": "PHOTOGRAPH ALBUM OF TELSCOMBE COMPILED BY AMBROSE GORHAM",
        "Description": "Introduction The album was compiled by Ambrose Gorham, (born 28 October 1853; died 30 June 1933) who lived at Stud House, Telscombe, The album was produced as a project to commemorate Telscombe, and all the photographs were taken in the summer of 1904, probably in July or early August. Beatrice Annie Windless was pregnant when she was photographed either with her son Walter or an older child (AMS6595/1 p18 below); her daughter Norah Winifred was born on 16 August 1904 (baptised 16 October 1904). The baby held by Mary Reed (AMS6595/1 p48 below) was probably Eveline Violet Reed who was born 30 June 1904 (baptised 31 July 1904), not Stephen as suggested in the caption. Further information concerning the people photographed can be obtained from the 1901 census returns (PRO RG13/0919; ESRO XA81/160) and the Telscombe baptism register (PAR 491/1/2/1; transcript available) The population of Telscombe at the time of the 1901 census was 120 (61 males and 59 females), so well over half the parish are represented here. The more important members of the community are included, such as Charles Steyning Beard, who lived at the Manor House, and the rector; employees of Gorham (not resident in the village at the time of the 1901 census) and some employees of Beard are shown. In all probability they were all inhabitants of the village itself, and people who lived in Brighton Road or Telscombe Cliff (including the coastguards) were excluded. The name of the photographer is unknown, but may well have been Gorham himself: the initials on the album cover are those of his signature, and the shadow of the photographer which is occasionally visible looks like his The recipient of the album, Frederic John Poole, became rector of St John-sub-Castro, Lewes, in 1910, and was Prebendary of Hurst in Chichester Cathedral in 1911. It is likely that he or a member of his family added the captions on the photographs, the text of which has been italicised in this list. AMS6595/2-3 were found inside the album Ambrose Gorham owned race horses, which trained on the gallops on Telscombe Tye. His horse Shannon Lass won the Grand National in 1902, and Gorham celebrated by restoring Telscombe church. He purchased Telscombe Farm, including the sheep rights or common pasture on Telscombe Tye, from the trustees of Henry Smith's Charity on 17 September 1923. He eventually owned 260 acres of farmland in the locality, including much of the village of Telscombe, with the exception of the manor of Telscombe, which Charles William Neville purchased from James Ambrose Harman on 1 September 1924. He employed many of the village inhabitants, and was a local benefactor who gave every child a book and a pair of Wellington boots at Christmas. He built the Village Club, a hall near the Manor House, for the village as a place of recreation Gorham died on 30 June 1933, and bequeathed his Telscombe property and rights to Brighton Corporation for retention in perpetuity, in order that the village should remain unspoiled. A charitable trust scheme, called Gorham's Gift, was established by an order of the High Court in December 1935 to ensure the preservation of the area 'with its present rural characteristics in order that the public and especially the inhabitants of Telscombe, Piddinghoe and Brighton may have recourse thereto for quiet and peaceful recreation and meditation'. The property was administered by the trust and for a long period was leased to Ernest Thornton-Smith until the latter's death in 1971. In May 1975 the aim of the trustees was described as 'to renovate and repair the dwellings under their control in Telscombe, to improve the conditions and appearance of the village and to work towards creating a fully populated living community'",

        "Description": "The collection consists of black and white photocopies of letters, photographs and papers sent to Mrs Birt mainly by children in Canada who had previously stayed at the Sheltering Homes. They give an interesting insight into the life of orphans who were sent to Canada and their close relationship with Mrs Birt. Many of the photocopies include notes on the items made by Nick Wraith, the owner of the original letters and papers.\nAdministrative history: In the late 1860s Alexander Balfour and Stephen Williamson, partners in the Liverpool ship-owning firm Balfour, Williamson and Co., became concerned at the numbers of destitute and orphaned children in Liverpool. While attending a conference in London, Balfour along with another Liverpool shipowner John Houghton, heard Annie Macpherson lecture on her work concerning child migration. They approached her to give a lecture in Liverpool, but due to other commitments she was unable to do this, but her sister Louisa Birt, who had assisted her in her work, was willing to come to Liverpool. In November 1872 a public meeting was held in the Law Association Rooms in Cook Street at which Louisa Birt explained the objects and methods of her work. It was resolved that a society be established in Liverpool to further this work, with the fundraising and management of the home to be kept separate from the London organisation. John Houghton offered the use of premises adjoining the old Byrom Hall Baptist Chapel in Bryom Street, free of both rent and running costs. Formally opened on the 1st May 1873, the purpose of the Liverpool Sheltering Homes was to rescue destitute and neglected children, train them in the home and to accompany groups to a new life in Canada. From Marchmont House in Ontario they were to be placed with good families although they remained to be supervised and visited until they reached the age of eighteen. With the death of John Houghton in 1883, Liverpool Sheltering Homes had to make the payments for the rent and running costs of the premises, which were felt to be overcrowded and unsuitable. Work began to build a new Home in Myrtle Street, formally opened by Mrs Balfour on 16th November 1889, with a further block of adjacent land given to the Homes in 1895. Mrs Birt ceased active work in the Homes in 1911 but the family involvement was continued by her daughter Miss Lilian Birt. Mrs Birt died on the 7th May 1915, aged 74. During Louisa Birt's lifetime an estimated 6000 children were emigrated to Canada by the Liverpool Sheltering Homes. The Homes closed temporarily during the First World War, reopening in 1919. Six years later it was amalgamated with Dr Barnardo's, who closed their own Home in Liverpool and operated out of Myrtle Street. Miss Lilian Birt retired at the time of the amalgamation, though continued her involvement in an advisory capacity. After the amalgamation the Home became used as a migration and training centre for boys who had left school before they migrated to Canada. In the late 1920s as migration to Canada ceased, it became used as a home for schoolboys until it was eventually closed in 1935 and the building was purchased by the Corporation of Liverpool for use as a Juvenile Employment Centre.\nArrangement: The collection is arranged as follows 920 BIR 1 Papers relating to Edith Barker 920 BIR 2 Papers relating to George Fisher 920 BIR 3 Papers relating to George Eaton 920 BIR 4 Papers relating to Mildred Cade 920 BIR 5 Papers relating to Jessie Roberts 920 BIR 6 Papers relating to Sarah Jones and her children 920 BIR 7 Papers sent by the Liverpool Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children",

In 1908 an office was found in Seel St with Margart Beavan acting as Secretary. The aim of the work was to help invalid and crippled needy children, and to improve ante-natal care. The importance of the role of the mother in the household was recognised and the Association tried to ease their burden by providing holidays for them. Several institutions were established by the CWA to help both children and mothers. In 1913 the Leasowe Open-Air Hospital for children up to the age of 16 was opened. One wing was used as a Babies Hospital, but the increased number of patients led to a separate Hospital for Babies in Woolton. Convalescent Homes, such as the Ellen Gonner Home in West Kirby, and Beechley in Allerton, were acquired and many thousands of children were given medically supervised holidays. Apart from medical help, the Association also gave one off grants of money, furniture or clothes to families with children in need. Many prominent people were involved with the CWA, including the Earl and Countess of Derby and several Lord Mayors. The name most closely associated with the CWA is that of Margaret Beavan, who was Secretary and Director of the Association from 1908 to her death in 1931. She was known as the 'little Mother of Liverpool' and worked tirelessly for all children. After her death her former secretary, Christine Finchett became Director. 'Photographs and other papers relating to Margaret Beavan's Mayoralty and including many photographs of her involvement with children can be found at 920MBE.) By the 1970s much of the work of the Association had been replaced by state provision and it was taken over by the Personal Service Society (see 364PSS).",

Her mother had a strong influence on her life. Kate Turner thought it would be good for her daughters, all unmarried, to have a child to look after. An abandoned one was found and officially adopted. The boy, Geoffrey Grey, was brought up by Helen and Evelyn. When Helen died, Evelyn looked after him. She sent him to boarding school. Despite his unusual upbringing Geoffrey developed normally and made a happy marriage. Soon after the birth of his son Martin, he was killed in a road accident. This disaster, plus a fear that she was going blind and would be unable to read, caused Evelyn to kill herself. From the age of 7 she kept a daily journal until the day before her death.

The training was hard and strict and there was no pay for the first year. She qualified as a midwife and because she intended to go abroad to nurse, it was necessary for her to train in infectious diseases. This could only be taken at the London Fever Hospital. The donor recalls her mother talking about the appalling conditions she encountered in the homes in the East End. In many houses children were employed making match boxes and the chenille trimmings for table clothes. In such surroundings, infectious disease was endemic. After a period of private nursing, Amy applied to the Colonial Office for the nursing post in Bangkok. As she had no reply to her letter, she wrote again. Her mother then confessed that she had torn up the reply to her first letter, because she did not want her to go abroad. Photographer: Barcroft and Crabtree, Burnley, Nelson and Bacup.",

He was an artistic photographer who also made portraits and technical photographs. On 28 July 1912, Halberstadt became engaged to the daughter of Sigmund and Martha Freud, Sophie. They married in Hamburg on 14 January 1913. Their first child, Ernst Wolfgang, was born on 11 March 1914. He was the child Sigmund Freud observed playing \u201cFort-da\u201d with a cotton reel and wrote about in a chapter in \u2018Beyond the Pleasure Principle\u2019. They had another son, named Heinz, born in Schwerin in 1918. Halberstadt photographed his father-in-law and the portrait of Freud holding his cigar has become iconic. His earliest portrait of Freud was published with the article \u201cDer Sch\u00f6pfer der Neuen Seelenkunde (Professor Sigmund Freud)\u201d by Theodor Reik in 1914. As well as being a respected portrait photographer, Halberstadt was one of the founding members of the Gesellschaft Deutscher Lichtbildner. In 1920, Sophie\u2019s life was tragically cut short due to the interwar influenza epidemic. She was 26 when she died. Three years later Heinz died from tuberculosis. In 1923, Halberstadt married a woman called Berta. In 1936, Halberstadt emigrated to South Africa to escape the increasing persecution of the National Socialists. He died in Johannesburg on 30 December 1940.",

        "Title": "Nugent Archive",
        "Description": "Nugent is a charitable organisation which offers support to adults and children across Liverpool and throughout the North West of England. The archive focuses on the lives of two Liverpool priests Father James Nugent and Father John Bennett, pioneers of social welfare and child care. The archive contains 24 books and 248 folders, 272 items in total, including; letters, pamphlets, brochures, journals and photographs. A list of these items can be found on the Nugent Archive database, available to download from the Liverpool Hope University Archives & Special Collections webpages. The archive also includes Father Nugent's letters written during his time as Chaplain of the Walton Gaol and as co-founder of the Liverpool Catholic Children's Protection Society; Monsignor Bennett's correspondence letters - covering subjects such as child welfare, juvenile delinquency, child psychology, and the end of child emigration to Canada; and also Bennett's correspondence with Lady Laycock and the development of care of deprived children in Malta.\nAdministrative history: The origins of Nugent date back to the 1800's and the pioneering work of James Nugent, (1822-1905), in relation to child welfare, relief from poverty and social reform. Monsignor James Nugent, better known as Father Nugent, was a Roman Catholic Priest of the Archdiocese of Liverpool. He was a passionate social reformer, appalled by the state of the homeless living in the squalor of Victorian England, he dedicated his life to the education and rescue of destitute children.His statue (created in 1906) can be seen today in St John's Gardens, adjoining St George's Hall in Liverpool. The plaque on the statue reads 'Apostle of Temperance, Protector of the Orphan Child, Consoler of the Prisoner, Reformer of the Criminal, Saviour of Fallen Womanhood, Friend of all in Poverty, a foot to the lame, the Father of the Poor.' The work of Father Nugent had a dramatic impact on the lives of thousands of vulnerable people and his work continues to this day, through the charity organisation Nugent. Monsignor John Bennett, (1891-1965), was the administrator of The Catholic Reformatory Association, The Catholic Children's Protection Society and Father Berry's Homes, for over 40 years. He was able to build upon the pioneer work for child welfare, in Liverpool, by previous administrators - Monsignors Nugent and Pinnington. He was an important character in the developing form of social welfare, where his influence and expertise often extended beyond Liverpool. He was involved at national level serving as part of the Central Advisory and Training Council. At international level, he was directly involved in the development of child welfare in Malta, after an appeal by the Governess of Malta, Lady Laycock. Canon Bennett would become the biographer of Monsignor James Nugent in 1949, when he wrote the book, Father Nugent of Liverpool.\nArrangement: In numerical order. Nugent material listed first, followed by material from the Bennett years.\nPhysical condition: Four archival boxes containing books, letters, pamphlets, magazines, photographs and ephemera",

        "Description": "Alfred Edward and Dorothy Gertrude (nee Lamble) Tamlin were both from Sparkhill in Birmingham, and knew each other from early childhood. Alfred joined the army in 1914 but was invalided out in 1915, at which point he joined the trading company Miller Bros in West Africa, according to his daughter. However in 1918 he was working in the Motor Transport Dept. of Swanzy's Ltd, which merged with Millers and the African Association in 1919 to form the African and Eastern Trade Corporation Ltd. Alfred's main duty was to oversee African labourers cutting and preparing mahogany for export, floating the huge logs down the Volta River to be loaded onto ships. All the captioned photographs were taken in the Gold Coast, now Ghana, but it is possible he also worked in other West African locations. Alfred returned home to marry Dorothy in 1919, after which she accompanied him for 2 years before going back to the UK for the birth of their first child in August 1921. In 1923 the family emigrated to Canada, however Alfred suffered with recurrent malaria for the rest of his life and died in Birmingham at the age of 61. The photographs in the collection depict the Tamlins' life in West Africa between 1917 and 1920. The main focus is on Alfred's working life, with a large number of images of the mahogany preparation and shipping process, as well as scenes of early motor transport and company social occasions. However there are also a significant number of images reflecting the lives of local people, with street scenes, landmarks, ceremonies and portraits. This catalogue was produced with support from the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art.\nNote: British Empire and Commonwealth Collection https://becc.bristol.gov.uk/records/1995/074",

        "Description": "Margaret Clark (1878-1962) was the fifth child of William Stephens Clark and Helen Priestman Bright Clark. Margaret was particularly close to Isabella Pasley, the Millfield Governess with whom she spent much of her early childhood. Miss Pasley was later to leave much of her estate to Margaret. Margaret was first sent to school in Bournemouth and then attended the Quaker Brighthelmstone School in Birkdale, Southport under Hannah Wallis (who had also taught her mother). In 1897 she went up to Newnham College, Cambridge studying first Maths then Economics. At Cambridge she became very active in student liberal politics, campaigning both against the Boer War and for women's suffrage. These interests continued after her graduation in 1901, Margaret often following in the footsteps of her Mother and Priestman Aunts. Margaret first met Emily Hobhouse in 1902 at the home of relation Sophy Sturge. Through the correspondence here it is possible to learn of Margaret's impressions of Miss Hobhouse and her growing need to find purposeful work which led to her travelling to South Africa to assist with the Boer Home Industries in 1905 and 1907. Following her marriage in 1909 to Arthur Bevington Gillett, Margaret moved to Oxford where the couple had four children. She continued her connections with South Africa throughout the remainder of her life, particularly through her enduring friendship with Jan and Isie Smuts whom she had met in 1905. The GIL collection contains extensive correspondence, diaries, papers and photographic material relating to Margaret Clark Gillett which is arranged in two main sections. Material relating to her pre-married life and her personal papers is listed at GIL/MC. Material relating to her married life and family activities is listed at GIL/FAM. There are also significant collections of historical material which Margaret inherited. Of particular significance are papers of her grandfather John Bright, her Priestman great aunts and her mother Helen Priestman Bright Clark. There are also rich collections of family photographs. These are listed at GIL/HIST",

On leaving school at the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to a steel firm in Carlisle Street.After a spell at the Birley Collieries he accepted a job at the Sheffield Coal Company, where his father had worked.Later he went into the coal business on his own account with an office in 7 Castle Street. In September 1880 he married Mary Elizabeth Storm. Their first child, Frank Storm Mottershaw, was born in 1881, and their second son Arthur was born around 1884. Their eldest daughter Edith Marion was born in 1885. Frank Mottershaw had taken up photography around 1875 and would take and develop photographs while on holiday in Fife, Scotland. He decided to use his home as a studio and fit in some portrait work in his spare time.Recognising the opportunities offered through the buying and selling of cameras he abandoned his coal business and set up in West Bar in 1887 as a photographer and dealer in photographic equipment.In 1889 he moved the business to Fargate near Chapel Walk, opposite Cole Brothers.The studio for portraiture was behind the shop, selling a variety of photographic goods. Artists' requisites were introduced as an additional line.This proved a successful innovation and in 1890 a shop was opened in Pinstone Street. Eventually it became necessary to vacate the Fargate premises due to redevelopment and in 1896 both businesses moved to 95 Norfolk Street, which also became the family home. While living there, Frank and Mary had their third son, Walter (c.1895), followed by a daughter called Jessie (c.1897), another son, Harry (c.1900), and finally Edward Richard (c.1902). By 1900 the two elder sons had joined the family business and, encouraged by their father, Frank Storm and Arthur had become interested in moving pictures.After making their own projector from old camera parts they were later able to buy a new cine-camera and projector.The Mottershaws took pictures of football matches and other topical events, which were shown to audiences the next day or sometimes the same evening. The Mottershaws were among the first filmmakers to exploit the possibilities of filming out of doors on location, and situations were devised so as to avoid interior scenes, wherever possible.Titling was also carried out in the garden studio in daylight using white enameled letters set at an angle against a board covered with black velvet, a fancy border being cut from plywood. An early assignment for Frank Storm Mottershaw was to take a film unit to Serbia in company with Arnold Muir Wilson, Consul to Serbia, to record ceremonial details of King Peter\u2019s coronation. Frank Mottershaw senior was developing short stories that could be used as a basis for making a film.The first of these had been 'The Daylight Burglary\u2019' (also known as 'A Daring Daylight Robbery'), which was made in 1903; five hundred copies were sold outright and the negative was eventually disposed of in America. It was one of the first picture stories using natural scenery as a background entirely without stage settings. The Sheffield Photo Company\u2019s best known film was probably 'The Life of Charles Peace' (1905) but it appears to have been irretrievably lost. The version that has survived was made by the showman Walter Haggar.The total output of fictional films was only 63, of which 41 were made between 1904 and 1906; none were made after 1909, although the company continued in the documentary and topical field.Nevertheless, the Sheffield Photo Company had been the most important film producer in the North of England. Around 1908 the business decided to move away from film making due to rising costs and competition from the United States of America, and concentrate on retail, as amateur photography was booming due to the convenience of the newly introduced roll film cameras.The Sheffield Photo Company responded by organising a quick service for developing and printing. By 1911 Jessie had left school and had been absorbed into the retail business. In 1924 the business moved to 6 Norfolk Row but space was limited and the developing and printing department was located in Sidney Street. The records Sheffield Archives holds begin from the time the business became registered as a company. On the 19 Jan 1928 the Sheffield Photo Company Limited was registered, with Frank senior as Chairman, his daughter Jessie the Company Secretary, his wife Mary Elizabeth (who had always played a very active role in the business), and sons Walter Nelson, Henry and Edward Richard as directors. This business would be a dealer in photographic materials and apparatus. Earlier in 1927 a sister company was registered, Photo Finishers (Sheffield) Limited. This was set up by Fred Mottershaw, his son Henry Mottershaw, William McIntosh and James Christie. They borrowed \u00a33,000 from Kodak Limited to buy some premises to develop a photographic laboratory, with the idea that Kodak would be issued the balance of the Shares Capital in Photo Finishers in order to give them the 51% controlling interest which they desired, and that Kodak paper and chemicals should be used exclusively by the laboratory. The directors of the business originally bought a property on William Street, which was not ideal for their purposes but decided it was the best they could get, and alterations were made to it. Then, almost immediately, more suitable premises in the form of an old chapel on Union Road/Osborne Road in the Nether Edge area became available, which they bought as well. This would become Cherry Tree Laboratories, the long-term home of the business. By 1930/1931 Kodak had decided not take up its option of acquiring a controlling interest, which in fact had been obtained by Sheffield Photo Company Limited and its Directors. Mottershaws served on its board of directors, but it was not until 1931 that Henry Mottershaw became its Chairman, a position he would hold until his death in 1967. This firm would specialise in photographic developing and printing, industrial, advertising and commercial photography. Frank Mottershaw died 18 Sep 1932. His wife became Chairman of the Sheffield Photo Company Limited during the 1930s, leading the company through the Second World War and the challenges of post war Britain, until her death in 1956. Her son Henry would become Chairman of both companies, and after his death, his brother Edward Richard would become the Chairman of the Sheffield Photo Company Limited, while Henry\u2019s son Ian A.Mottershaw would become Chairman of Photo Finishers (Sheffield) Limited. The period from the 1930s through to the end of the 1960s saw both businesses responding to the demands of the growth of amateur photography, increasing competition, dealing with different aspects of government legislation, changes in technology and material and labour shortages during the Second World War and through into the post war period. In 1956 Photo Finishers (Sheffield) Limited resumed film production with the formation of an associate company, Mottershaw Commercial Films. This produced commercial films such as promotional films or documentaries, its first being a 16mm documentary for Sheffield City Libraries (Books in Hand). In 1966 Photo Finishers (Sheffield) Limited purchased Montgomery Chapel near Cherrytree works on Union Road and transferred the Commercial Department there. This became known as Montgomery Studios and was a commercial and advertising photographer under the title of Mottershaw Photography. Mottershaw Commercial Films also moved to Montgomery Studios and was still producing films in 1978. Future Chairman John R Mottershaw produced and directed a number of films in the 1960s in this small, but profitable section of the business. By 1970 the Sheffield Photo Company employed 21 full time male staff and 15 part time members of staff. In that year the Sheffield Photo Company Limited and Photo Finishers (Sheffield) Limited had a new Chairman, John R Mottershaw, the son of Edward Richard Mottershaw and grandson of the founders of the business. While in the past both companies had often relied on independent dealers (such as chemists) to sell and market some of their products, in 1971 the long-term objectives of the business was to establish a chain of retail shops. Shops were established around the country, and by 1982 the Sheffield Photo Company Limited has increased its owned or control outlets from 26 to 33. The character of the shops and their trading policy was converted to that of a Developing and Printing shop rather than a camera shop. Changes were also made with Photo Finishers (Sheffield) Limited. At an Extraordinary General Meeting held 19 Mar 1974, it was resolved that the name of the Photo Finishers (Sheffield) Limited was to be changed to \u2018Cherytree Laboratories Limited\u2019. By 1977 they were producing about 10 million colour prints a year. On 29 May 1975 Photocare Limited was registered as subsidiary of Cherytree Laboratories Limited. Its principal activity was the marketing of photographic products. As with the Sheffield Photo Company, the aim was to seek to extend and market through their own or associated outlets.By 1979 the company had 21 outlets. It was under Photocare Limited that the mail order business was directed. In 1980 another subsidiary was created, Photoco Snapshops Marketing Limited. By 1981 a Photoco SnapShop Franchise was to be put into operation, and by that time too an In-Store Franchise had already been successfully launched into a dozen or so shops, with plans to extend to others. The company\u2019s strategy was to collect marketing fees from franchisees, including Sheffield Photo Company Limited and to allocate these funds entirely to marketing activities. The company also collected royalty payments on behalf of Cherrytree Laboratories Limited. Photoco Silver Technology Limited (formerly John David Grange Limited) was also created as a subsidiary company of Cherrytree Laboratories Limited, and other businesses were bought as a means of expanding around the country. By 1983 the Sheffield Photo Company group employed 150 people, and had 34 shops in the north and midlands. However, the company faced cash flow problems due to the highly competitive nature of the photographic industry. By December 1982 the Directors decided that Photoco Snapshop (Marketing) Limited and Photocare Limited should become dormant companies and their book keeping incorporated into Sheffield Photo Company Limited and Cherrytree Laboratories respectively. During 1983 redundancies to the Board and staff were made, long-term managers left the company as the business declined, certain sites closes, night-shifts stopped, and a non-executive director was hired on a fee paying basis on the Bank\u2019s recommendation. On 8 Sep 1983 the Sheffield Star reported the Sheffield Photo Company and its other companies had gone into receivership, and the company was wound up in 1984.

        "Description": "The material deposited at the London Metropolitan Archives is of great value to the study of nearly every aspect of the Suburb's history. It is a collection that is of both local and national importance as a source for studying planned settlements, architecture, and the life and work of Henrietta Barnett. As a brief overview, this collection consists of records of the HGS Trust; papers of Samuel and Henrietta Barnett; records of suburb organisations and recreational societies; records of educational institutions; an oral history section; approximately 10,000 plans and 10,000 photographs.\nAdministrative history: Henrietta and Samuel Barnett Hampstead Garden Suburb is an area of outstanding architectural importance situated to the north west of London. In 1951, Nikolaus Pevsner in his Buildings of England - Middlesex described it as 'the aesthetically most satisfactory and socially most successful of C20 garden suburbs.' The Suburb was the vision and accomplishment of Henrietta Octavia Barnett (later Dame Henrietta). Henrietta was born in 1851 to a wealthy family. However, from a young age she wanted to help the less privileged. In 1873 she married Canon Samuel Barnett who also saw his vocation as working amongst the poor. So as soon as the couple were married, they moved to Whitechapel to be amongst the poverty and appalling housing conditions. Together they aimed to encourage self-discipline and self-help amongst the working class community. Samuel and Henrietta remained in Whitechapel until 1907. Samuel Barnett was the vicar of St. Jude's, Whitechapel (and later became Canon of Bristol and Westminster), and in 1884, Samuel and Henrietta founded Toynbee Hall, a university settlement where they both worked as wardens. The idea of a Garden Suburb arose as a result of these experiences of East End poverty. Henrietta wanted to create an estate where the working classes could live within pleasant surroundings. The Garden Suburb concept itself was derived from the views of Ebenezer Howard and the Garden Cities Movement. Origins of the Suburb Whilst working in Whitechapel, the Barnetts had one escape from their surroundings - a weekend cottage in Hampstead which they had named St. Jude's. However, the fields surrounding the cottage came under threat when in 1900 an American businessman, Charles Terson Yerks, resurrected an 1893 scheme to extend the underground from Charing Cross to Hampstead and Golders Green. This would have given easy access to the nearby Wyldes farm and have opened the way for speculative builders. Henrietta set about purchasing these 80 acres of land (originally priced at \u00a348,000) to preserve the unspoilt countryside of the Heath, and at the same time to develop her Garden Suburb. Initially she wanted to place these 80 acres of Heath Extension in the ownership of the London County Council in perpetuity. However, it soon became obvious that the plan to build a Garden Suburb would only succeed if more land was acquired. This meant purchasing the whole of the Wyldes Estate, a total of 323 acres. In 1903 the Hampstead Heath Council was formed for the purpose of purchasing the initial 80 acres of land from Eton College by public subscription. Henrietta Barnett was the Honorary Secretary and launched an appeal straight away. She also needed to get the sympathy of the local councillors, which she hoped to do by proclaiming that the suburb would solve Hampstead's housing problems. However, when the Eton College Trustees received Henrietta's offer of purchase, she was refused on the account that she was 'merely' a woman. So she formed a 'syndicate of eight' which included Lord Crewe, Lord Grey, Sir John Goriest, Sir Robert Hunter, Herbert Farnham, Walter Hazel, the Bishop of London, Dr Winnington and herself (two Earls, two lawyers, two free Churchmen, a bishop and a woman.) Their first meeting took place on 12th May 1904 when they constituted themselves as the Garden Suburb Trust. Their aim was to carry on the Heath Extension campaign and at the same time plan the layout of the Garden Suburb. Negotiations with the Eton trustees continued and company formation was discussed. In March 1906, the Garden Suburb Trust became the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust Ltd. Finally, on 27th March 1907, all of the land was conveyed to the London County Council. This 323 acres of land had cost \u00a3140,000. Building the Suburb In 1905 Henrietta published an article in the Contemporary Review stating that she wanted to create a place where the rich and poor could live together. The estate would be aesthetically pleasing as it would consist of low density housing and would be planned as a whole, a mixture of buildings and nature. The community would be served by a range of local amenities including churches, libraries, schools and shops. It would be a suburb for all, the old, the young and the handicapped. Nobody would be excluded. Henrietta wanted to bring different classes together rather than create a classless community. She hoped that the result would avoid the worst evils of conventional suburbs of the time - social segregation and the destruction of the countryside. In Henrietta's own words from her article in the Contemporary Review: 'that the part should not spoil the whole, nor the individual rights be allowed to work communal or individual wrongs - hence, that houses should not spoil each other's outlook; that the estate be planned not piecemeal, but as a whole; that houses should not be in uniform lines, nor close relationship, nor built regardless of each other, nor without consideration for picturesque appearance; that each house be surrounded by its own garden; and that there be agencies for fostering interest in gardens and allotments and for the co-operative lending of tools; that every road be planted with trees and be not more than 40' wide; that the noise of the children be locally limited; that there be all the advantages of a community - houses of prayer, a library, schools, a lecture hall, club houses, shops, baths, washhouses, bakehouses, refreshment rooms, arbours, co-operative stores, playgrounds for smaller children and resting places for the aged who cannot walk far.' The head architect employed by Henrietta was Raymond Unwin. He had the responsibility of surveying and planning the estate as a whole. Edwin Lutyens was appointed to plan the centrepiece, Central Square. In choosing names for the Suburb roads, Henrietta Barnett and Raymond Unwin looked to a variety of sources for inspiration. Some were old countryside place names, e.g. Willifield, Asmuns and Temple Fortune. Others were names of the those who had helped secure the Suburb, Grey, Falloden and Winnington. There were also names of the first Board of Co-Partnerships, Brunner, Greenhalgh and Litchfield. There were names of architects, Sutcliffe and Lucas; names of lawyers, Denman, Erskine and Chatham; names of poets, Wordsworth, Coleridge and Kingsley; and names of artists, Turner, Reynolds and Raeburn. It was on the 2nd May 1907, that Henrietta ceremoniously cut the first sod of grass. Building work form this point was rapid, and by October of the same year the houses that are now known as 140 and 142 Hampstead Way were completed. Also in 1907, Central Square was constructed with its showcase buildings of St. Jude's' Church, the Free Church, and the Institute. Although the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust Ltd. owned and administered the suburb, a large section of the housing was built by the Co-Partnership companies. The Co-Partnership Tenants Ltd. was formed in June 1907, and they aimed to build houses for all classes, but especially for the working class. They had a dividend limitation of 5% which limited their profits. The tenants of the houses were the investors, and after expenses had been deducted, surplus profits were divided amongst these tenants in proportion to the rent that they paid. This profit was given in shares only. Other companies which were involved in the construction of housing in the period before the First World War were the Improved Industrial Dwelling Company Ltd. and the Garden Suburb Development Company (Hampstead) Ltd. There were also Suburb Tenants Societies who elected their own Board of Management. The Hampstead Tenants Ltd. and the Second and Third Hampstead Tenants Ltd. (formed 1907, 1909 and 1910 respectively) and finally the Oakwood Tenants Ltd. formed in 1913. The impact of all these companies was considerable, as they increased the size of the Suburb by more than twofold during the period in which they were building. The modern Suburb consists of three developmental areas. The first area of development was the 243 acres of freehold bought by the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust Ltd. from the Eton College Trustees in 1907 and the 'Hendon Leasehold Estate' which was leased by the Trust in 1908 from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. This area is now known as the 'old Suburb'. The second area was leased from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners in 1911-12. This land in Finchley was assigned to the Co-Partnership Tenants Ltd. in 1919. The third wave of development was to the north and east of the 'old Suburb'. This was leased from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners by the Co-Partnership Tenants Ltd. and amounted to 300 acres. The Trust leased an additional 74 acres 'Finchley Leasehold Estate' and this became the 'new Suburb'. Even though these companies provided humbler housing, there was a shortage of working class residents. This was partly a result of the cost of the houses, but also it was because there was no local employment. Building costs rose during the First World War, and although the Co-Partners built more new houses, they tended to be for middle-class residents. Originally it had been intended that at least a third of the Suburb would consist of houses for the working class, however by 1918 only a tenth had been provided, and this number steadily decreased. Over time the Suburb became almost entirely middle class. It was also from the time of the First World War that relations between the Trust and the Co-Partners started to deteriorate. In November 1914, Unwin became the Chief Architect to the Local Government Board and in 1915 Sutcliffe, the Co-Partners' architect, died. The inflation of the 1920s resulted in less capital being available, and so it was more difficult to maintain the building work at the pre-war standard. Eventually building by the Co-Partners diminished and houses were built for sale. Finally the Co-Partnership companies were absorbed by Co-Partnership Tenants Ltd. The Suburb had grown rapidly before 1936, but by this date building had virtually been completed. The Suburb had become home to nearly 16,000 people. The idea of the Suburb being designed as a whole was greatly affected by the Barnet Bye-pass. Its impact was to dissect the Suburb. The building of the Bye-pass was announced by the Ministry of Transport in 1923. The Hampstead Garden Suburb Residents' Association immediately protested, however construction started in 1926, and by 1928 the road was finished. Plans to extend this road arose in the 1950s when Falloden Way, the Market Place and Lyttelton Road were designated to be part of the Lorry Route which would serve the docks. Opposition mounted steadily until eventually in 1967 a Joint Action Committee (which included the Residents' Association) was formed. In 1968 a public enquiry was held and the scheme was abandoned. The Second World War also had its impact. Due to the Suburb's proximity to Hendon Aerodrome, many bombs fell in the area. The Club House (designed by Unwin), for example, was destroyed, and later replaced by the Fellowship House. The architectural importance of the area still remained despite the bombing, and in 1964 and 1965 the Ministry of Housing and Local Government recognised that more than 60 of the older buildings were of special architectural interest and placed them on a statutory list of protected buildings. In 1974, the London Borough of Barnet established the whole of the Suburb as one of five Conservation Areas within its boundaries. The Department of the Environment designated the whole of the 'old Suburb' and some parts of the 'new Suburb' built before the First World War as an outstanding Conservation Area. In 1996, more than 500 of the earliest buildings with their Arts and Crafts doors, tiles and fireplaces were listed as Grade II, and nearly 30 of the larger houses were upgraded from Grade II to Grade II*. Facilities in the Suburb Henrietta wanted the Suburb to contain all the facilities that were needed by each individual within the local community. The facilities listed below are described in more detail if they feature significantly in the archives. Places of learning included the Institute, the Henrietta Barnett School, Child's Way School and the Wellgarth Nursery Training College. The Institute, 'the home of education in the suburb', was founded in March 1908. It was a place to learn and study (it housed a library) and it encouraged groups and societies, concerts, debates and conferences. It was also a place for entertainment where many theatrical productions were staged, especially by the Play and Pageant Union (formed in 1920). When the North Wing of the Institute was completed, a small kindergarten for six children opened in 1912. This was the origins of the Henrietta Barnett Junior and Senior Schools. The school expanded to become an infant school in 1909, and a junior high school in 1914. Both of these schools were only intended to be temporary. In 1914, boys were excluded and made to attend the newly opened Child's Way School (a school for boys and girls up to the age of 12 years). The Board of Education recognised the Barnett School as a two form entry Independent Secondary School for Girls in 1920. In 1938, the Junior School moved out of the Institute into its own premises in Bigwig Road, and in 1940 the Infants' school was demolished after land mine damage. In 1966 plans were underway to remove the remainder of the school to a site in Chalgrove Gardens. The Wellgarth Nursery Training College was founded in 1911 by the Women's Industrial Council in a purpose built building. Students had to be at least 17 years of age and undertook a year of study. Trainee nurses were taught children's laundry work, cooking, housewifery, physiology, hygiene, needlework and child psychology. Communal living facilities for certain groups of people were also built to fulfil Henrietta's objective to provide for all in the Suburb. The Orchard and Adelaide House were built for the elderly, Waterlow and Meadway Court for single professional women and Queen's Court and Emmott Close were sponsored by the United Women's Homes Association. The Orchard was designed by Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin in 1908. Henrietta wanted a place where elderly people could live in one bedroom flats at reasonable prices. When the original building fell into disrepair in the 1960s, the Residents' Association intervened, and in 1964 the Orchard Housing Society Ltd. was registered. The Orchard was demolished in 1970, and rebuilt to the design of the architect Michael Dark. Places of worship were adequately provided for in the Suburb. In March 1911, the foundation stones of the Free Church were laid, and in May 1911, St Jude's Church (named after the church in Whitechapel at which Samuel Barnett had been minister) was consecrated. Both were designed by Edwin Lutyens. In 1935, a synagogue was consecrated by the Chief Rabbi. For recreational purposes, the Friends Meeting House had opened in 1913, and there was also a community centre named Club House on Willifield Green. During the First World War it was used as a hospital for wounded soldiers. Sale of the Suburb In 1954, the Co-Partnership Tenants Ltd. made an unsuccessful bid for Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust shares. This take-over attempt encouraged the Trust to create 60,000 deferred shares which were held by organisations who would safeguard the future of the Trust. These were the Henrietta Barnett Board, the Hampstead Garden Suburb Institute, the Bournville Village Trust and the National Trust. By 1957, Co-Partnership Tenants Ltd. had become Suburb Leaseholds Ltd., and in 1959 these were taken over by Metrovincial Properties Ltd. In 1960, Metrovincial Properties Ltd. was sold to City and General Investments Company Ltd, which later became City Centre Properties Ltd. In 1961, the Directors of the Trust began to think about selling off the trust to clear debts. They had previously suggested that a 2,000 year lease of the Trust's property would be granted to the Suburb Leaseholds Ltd. for \u00a3553,930. The formation of a new Hampstead Garden Suburb Community Trust was also suggested to administer the suburb on behalf of certain charities. The response to the sale was the formation of the Protection Society by local residents in January 1962. The chairman was Jean Henderson. The Society's aim was to prevent the sale of the Suburb, and thus a petition was initiated which was heard in the High Court in May 1962. As a result, it was found that there were irregularities in the notice given by the Trust to the shareholders concerning its intentions to sell. In November 1963 the Protection Society merged with the Residents' Association (founded 1909 as the Garden Suburb's Ratepayers Association). The sale went ahead in 1961, when the Suburb was sold to the Clore Property Group. However, the Trust was prohibited from winding itself up and passing the proceeds to the proposed Hampstead Garden Community Trust. By October 1962 a public meeting was held at the Institute to open a Private Bill Fund. The aim was to take Parliamentary action to keep the suburb as Henrietta intended it to be. This was a reasonable precaution, as the Leasehold Reform Act, passed in 1967, had enabled residents to buy their freeholds. There was a serious risk of the character of Suburb being lost. In September 1968, the Trust was finally wound up. The Protection Society was instrumental in the subsequent formation of the two new organisations that would look after the Suburb. The New Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust would preserve amenities and the Hampstead Garden Suburb Charitable Trust would distribute surplus income. Also, in 1968, Suburb Leaseholds Ltd. applied for a Scheme of Management for the Suburb which would control leaseholders who decided to enfanchise. The Suburb was sold again in 1969 to the Ashdale Land and Property Co. Ltd. Some of Ashdale's interests were later bought by Freshwater Property Co. Ltd. In July 1970, a joint management scheme was planned by the New Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust Ltd. and Ashdale Property Company Ltd. At the same time the Protection Society announced that it was winding up business, as it had achieved all that it possibly could. It was not until 1974 that the application for the Scheme of Management was heard by the High Court. Once it was approved, the New Trust was able to act as attorney for all the Ashdale holdings in the Suburb.\nArrangement: The material in this archive has been arranged into the following series:- ACC/3816/01 TRUST ACC/3816/01/01 Regulations This series contains memoranda, articles of association, bye-laws and rules of the Trust and the Co-Partnership Companies.

        "Title": "Freeman Family Records",
        "Description": "Mrs Willett is the daughter of John Freeman's son, Thomas. In addition to these records, she also held a large number of photographs of the Freeman family and of her mother's family, the Shepleys. These photographs, together with some background information compiled by Mrs Willett, were deposited separately via Manchester Studies and can be found in box 1 of D-M21. The records in this collection consist of two small diaries and eight letters. They are all handwritten and are generally in good condition, although one or two pages are coming loose from the diaries. There are no restrictions on access.\nAdministrative history: According to information provided by Mrs Willett, Thomas Freeman was born on 26 March 1826. The census of 1881 records his birthplace as Saddleworth. By the census of 1841, his family were living in Lees and he was working as a cotton cardroom hand. His father, James, was a cloth dresser, and his mother's name was Maboth. At that date, Thomas appears to have had nine brothers and sisters, ranging in ages between nine months and twenty. Thomas married Elizabeth Brierley, who was born on 1 May 1828, also in Saddleworth. They seem to have had two children, both born in Saddleworth - John on 29 April 1854, and Amelia in January 1856. In 1865, Thomas was one of a party who travelled to Cawnpore in India to supervise the erection of cotton machinery and instruct the local population in its use. He is believed to be the author of a diary recording this event (ref D-AAI 1). The 1881 census records Thomas as a cotton spinner. At that date he was living at 59 Greengate Street, Oldham with his wife and daughter. Thomas, Elizabeth and Amelia Freeman do not appear to be on the 1891 census for Oldham. It is possible that they had moved to Whaleybridge by this time. Thomas died there on 5 January 1903, followed by Amelia on 2 June 1904, and Elizabeth on 7 March 1909. Thomas and Elizabeth's son, John, married Mary Barker on 7 June 1876. Mary had been born in Swinton in 1851. They had five children, William, Elizabeth, Thomas, James and Maboath. At the time of the 1881 census, they were living at 221 Lees Road, Oldham and the only child to be recorded was William, then aged one. John was described as an accountant. By 1891, they were at 62 Greengate Street, John was described as a cashier in a cotton mill, and of the children, only Thomas, aged nine, and James, aged five were recorded. Mrs Willett described John Freeman as being an early member of the Liberal Club in Oldham and an active member of the Methodist Church. He died on 24 September 1902. His widow, Mary, died on 4 December 1924.",

        "Title": "JOHN GROOM'S ASSOCIATION FOR DISABLED PEOPLE",
        "Description": "This collection contains administrative material for John Grooms Association itself and all its major projects, including minutes and financial material; publications produced by the charity, including appeal literature and advertisements; histories of John Groom and his charity; a large collection of photographs showing all aspects of the association with many photographs of residents, workers, children and others who have benefited from its work; films and videotapes produced by the charity along with video and audio tapes of advertisements and reports on the charity's work featured on television and radio programmes; samples of flowers made by the workers at Edgware and the tools used to make them.\nAdministrative history: John Alfred Groom was a London engraver and evangelical preacher, who became concerned with the plight of the poverty-stricken and often disabled girls and women who sold flowers and watercress in the streets around Farringdon Market. His work with them began when he founded the Watercress and Flower Girls' Christian Mission in 1866. A permanent home for the mission was found in Harp Alley and Lord Shaftesbury became its first president. Religious services were held at Foresters' Hall until its destruction in 1890, after which John Groom purchased Woodbridge Chapel, Clerkenwell. Taking inspiration from the trend for imported handmade flowers, John Groom set up a factory in Sekforde Street, close to the Woodbridge Chapel, where disabled girls could work at making artificial flowers and thus make a living for themselves. The girls lived in houses in Sekforde Street, rented by John Groom. Further factories were subsequently built in Woodbridge Street and Haywards Place. The name of the charity was changed to John Groom's Crippleage and Flower Girls Mission in 1907. Rising inner London rents forced the charity's council to purchase a large estate in Edgware in 1931 and the whole operation moved there in 1932. In 1965 Edgware opened its doors to male residents. The charity's name changed again in 1969 to John Groom's Association for the Disabled and in 1990 to John Groom's Association for Disabled People. John Groom was also very concerned for the welfare of deprived and orphaned children. He bought a house at Clacton-on-Sea and built others around it and his orphanage opened in 1890. During World War II the older children from Clacton were evacuated to Davenport House, Shropshire, with the babies being sent first to Edgware and then to Farncote House, Wolverhampton. After the war the older children moved into a new home at Pilgrim's House, Kent, and the babies moved to the new Cudham Hall, also in Kent. In 1956 Charnwood, near Chislehurst was purchased to provide a family children's home with room for 12 children. Thorpe Bay Children's Home was added to the list in 1951 when John Grooms took over a children's convalescent home at Stamford Hill House. The charity's work with children finally ended in 1979. John Grooms expanded its work with housing for the disabled during the early 1970s, with John Groom's Housing Association becoming a registered charity in its own right. The association's developments have included flats in Princess Crescent, Finsbury Park (1973), Dolphin Court, which was built on the site of the Thorpe Bay Children's Home (1984) and John Grooms Court, Norwich (1989). The charity has also developed the idea of special holidays for the disabled, with hotels in Minehead and Llandudno, and self-catering caravans and bungalows. It has also been involved with a special Brain Injuries Rehabilitation Unit, Icanho, in Stowmarket, and the HOPE Nursery at Cheshunt which provides horticultural employment and therapy for disabled workers.\nArrangement: The collection is arranged as follows: LMA/4305/01 - Minutes LMA/4305/02 - Financial material LMA/4305/03 - Central administration LMA/4305/04 - Administration of individual homes and projects LMA/4305/05 - Property records LMA/4305/06 - Publications, press cuttings and histories LMA/4305/07 - Photographs and transparencies LMA/4305/08 - Audio-visual material LMA/4305/09 - Related documentation LMA/4305/10 - Samples of flowers, crafts and tools",

        "Description": "This collection represents the business records of the architect's practice of Baron C. S. Underhill FRIBA including plans, business correspondence, photographs of projects, business diaries 1930 - 1964, and a few accounting records. There are a few personal letters amongst the correspondence as some of his clients were also friends.\nAdministrative history: Collingwoode Seymour Underhill (known as Coll) was born on October 29th 1892 in Edgbaston, Birmingham, the third child of Collingwoode and Clara Underhill. The family moved to Moseley in 1899 where Underhill remained until his death in 1964, leaving only to join his family near Evesham during the Second World War. Underhill was educated at a local private school which he left at the age of 16 in 1909. He was articled to the architect Lloyd F. Ward for 3 years after which time he began work for George A. Cox at 33 Newhall Street, Birmingham. In February 1915 Underhill left Cox's practice in order to take up a commission in the South Midland (Warwickshire) Royal Garrison Artillery. He qualified as a signalling instructor and spent his time in service in the UK. He was demobilised in February 1919 and rejoined Cox's practice. In January 1920 he went into partnership with Cox (see MS 2094/7/2-3) and following Cox's death in May of that year took charge of the practice. He became a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1929 (see MS 2094/8/3). Underhill had five articled pupils between 1920 and 1939. In 1937 he moved his offices from 33 to 9 Newhall Street. Most of his work from this time was in the field of domestic architecture and he designed a number of houses in a style heavily influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement. He was also engaged by the firm of Thornley and Knight, Paint and Varnish Manufacturers in Bordesley Green for whom he worked for the rest of his career. Underhill married Gladys Barton in July 1928 and he designed their marital home on St Albans Road, Moseley. He became a freemason in 1923 joining the Athol Lodge on Severn Street of which he was Worshipful Master in 1939. He later became Past Provincial Superintendent of Works. During the Second World War his work concentrated on war damage inspections and claims and he also worked for the War Department to survey requisitioned properties. His family moved to Harvington near Evesham where he also spent much of his time. After the war the family returned to Birmingham and continued with much reconstruction and war damage claim work. He undertook a lot of work for Thornley and Knight and also had a contract with Birmingham City Council's Education Committee for building a school at Grestone Avenue, Handsworth Wood. After recovering from a serious illness in 1954 Underhill continued to work up until his death in 1964.

        "Description": "\nAdministrative history: William Meikle was born in about 1860, of Scottish extraction. Meikle himself wrote that he was born at Tipton, although his birth certificate says Dudley (see 63/45). The Meikle family came to Walsall from Manchester and when William was a child the family lived in Caldmore, (see 63/45). He attended Queen Mary's Grammar School in the 1870's, (see 63/54), and went to Walsall School of Art c.1875. William had a brother, Douglas, and a sister, Jean. In later life he corresponded with a Mrs. Jays of Southwark, London, whom he called 'sis'; this lady may have been Jean, or another sister. William did not marry until he was 55, because of a 'broken romance' in his youth, (see 63/58). William became a clothier, with various business premises eventually settling at 111, Lichfield Street. In later life he lived at 26, Lichfield Street. Meikle travelled extensively through the British Isles - many of his annual holidays, from childhood to old age, were spent at Galloway. He also travelled widely in the Midlands. Meikle was a busy man with many interests, including drawing, writing, photography, local history and folklore and collecting antiques. He was a member of Walsall Photographic Society, Queen Mary's Club, Walsall Curling Club, the Ancient and Honourable Society of Cuckoos, and the Birmingham Archaeological Society. He was also a leading member of the Walsall Burns Club, and became its president in 1928. William Meikle died on 15th February, 1943.",

        "Title": "THE VEGETARIAN HOME FOR CHILDREN",
        "Description": "The collection includes a set of minute books from 1925-1983, giving details of committees and the general running of the home along with reports made by the matron, superintendent and secretary. Reports on the children themselves and their circumstances are included and there are numerous photographs of the homes and trips made. This is a most unique collection and insightful collection, particularly for those interesting in the history of vegetarianism and in turn-of-the-century ideas about raising orphaned children.\nAdministrative history: 'The Vegetarian Home for Children' was founded in 1874 by Mrs. Elizabeth Thompson, a slum-worker in Liverpool, with the aim of improving the lives of destitute children and their families. She began this work at her home at 24 Village Street, Liverpool, later moving to 59 Phoebe Anne Street. In 1897 the home became for children only with the principle of bringing up children in a family-type home and to be taught how to be good future citizens, learning crafts and skills and spending time in prayer. The first record of adherence to a vegetarian diet was in 1909, under the influence of Mrs. Jessie Hughes (daughter of Mrs. Thompson and matron of the home until 1926) and Helah Criddle (also a daughter of Mrs. Thompson and wife of Mr. John Criddle). The 'Humane Dietary', based upon practical moral and scientific principles was adopted as it was felt that 'the principles of humaness and fellowship with the animal kingdom would be of great value in developing the character of the homes' charges' (quote from Appeal leaflet, 1953). Homeopathic principles were also applied to the treatment of illnesses. In 1913 the institution moved to 'Kelmscott', Beaufort Drive, Wallasey, which was built on land given by Miss Christine Todd. In February 1935 it transferred to 'Orchard Dene', View Road, Rainhill, Lancashire. Owing to changes in Child Welfare regulations and to rising costs, by 1950 it was decided to sell Orchard Dene. The remaining children at the home who could not return to their own families or be placed elsewhere were sent to an affiliated home in Jersey called 'La Preference', which continued until 1984. From 1951 'The Vegatarian Children's Fund' and 'The Vegetarian Children's Charity' were set up to provide holidays, trips, etc., for underprivileged children, whilst also contributing to the upkeep of the Jersey home.\nArrangement: The archive is arranged as follows, but readers are advised to read the head-note of each section.\nPhysical condition: Good.",

        "Description": "A Personal and Family Papers B Diaries and Notebooks C Research Files D Publications E Correspondence F Organisations and Associations G Newspaper Cuttings H Photographs I Maps J Personalia\nAdministrative history: Charles Robert Senhouse Pitman was born in Bombay, 19 March 1890. When asked as a child what he would be he replied, 'A soldier and a sort of a naturalist.' He was educated in England at the Royal Naval School, Eltham, at Blundell's School in Tiverton, and at Sandhurst, which he left in 1909 having obtained a commission in the Indian Army. After a brief initial posting, Pitman joined the 27th Punjabi Regiment with which he stayed from 1910 to 1921 when he retired from the army to take up farming in Kenya. During his army career, which spanned World War I, Pitman fought in Mesopotamia, Egypt and France, and was awarded the D.S.O. and M.C. In 1924 he was offered the position of Game Warden of the Uganda Protectorate. After his marriage to Marjorie Fielding Duncan, he assumed this post which he held from 1925-1951, interrupted only by three years (1931-1933) spent in Northern Rhodesia as Acting Game Warden and undertaking a faunal survey, and by five years (1941-1946) during which he was Director, Security Intelligence (Uganda). After leaving Uganda in 1951, Pitman and his wife moved to London, England, where they spent their remaining years. During this time Pitman was very active with conservation and preservation groups such as the Elsa Foundation, the Fauna Preservation Society, and the Rare Breeds Survival Trust. He kept up an active correspondence with other naturalists such as Joy Adamson and C.J.P. Ionides particularly to confirm facts. Correspondence was one of the primary ways in which Pitman conducted his zoological, herpetological, and ornithological research, as he relied almost solely on his own observations or the first-hand observations of others for data. This is particularly apparent in his files relating to the second edition of his Guide to the Snakes of Uganda (1974). This book, which was originally published in serial form in the Uganda Journal (1936-1937), is the foundation for Pitman's reputation as a methodical and exhaustive herpetologist. He was not limited to one area of research, however, and planned to publish, and at the time of his death had completed the typescript of, a book on elephants. This was to have been illustrated with his own photographs, as were his other autobiographical books, A Game Warden Among His Charges (1931) and A Game Warden Takes Stock (1942). As well as books, Pitman's published a plethora of articles, in scientific and popular journals, magazines and newspapers. The public was well-acquainted with Pitman's work through radio interviews and newspaper articles concerning East Africa and the pressing need for game conservation. His support of museum collections, especially the Hebrew University, Natural History Museum, Liverpool Museum, The Royal Albert Museum, Exeter, and the American Museum of Natural History, New York, was generous and long-continued. For example, Pitman donated some three thousand meticulously documented clutches of eggs, to the Natural History Museum. Pitman's interest in documenting and observing everything around him never flagged, and he tirelessly compiled notes and data until shortly before his death. Judging by the anecdotes which are still repeated at the Natural History Museum, Pitman was respected and liked by most people he met. He died 22 September 1975 when he was 85 years old.\nArrangement: Pitman's careful filing system lent itself to obvious collection divisions, and its integrity has been maintained wherever possible. Collection division E, correspondence, comprises the letters and some papers found in unfiled chaos once the other divisions had been isolated\nNote: The Pitman Collection is catalogued on URICA under BRN 299618, and has the shelf mark Z MSS PIT.

Its jurisdiction covered both elementary and secondary education within the city, with responsibility for both church and board schools. The system of national education envisaged by the 1944 Education Act was established in the city, with nursery, primary, secondary and further education all provided by Bristol Education Committee. The most obvious features of post-war education in Bristol were the establishment of comprehensive secondary schools, beginning in Hengrove and Lockleaze in 1954, the expansion of the University of Bristol and the establishment of Bristol Polytechnic (later the University of the West of England). The establishment of Avon County Council in 1974 brought a temporary end to Bristol City Council's role as a Local Education Authority; this status was revived in 1996 when Avon was abolished and the new unitary authority for Bristol was formed.",

Her parents were Irish and her father co-owned a chemical works (Boke, Roberts) in Stratford. It moved to Walthamstow in 1974. Winifred was educated at private schools including, briefly, St. Felix, South Wold and Polam Hall (Durham). Winifred also attended a short course at the Gloucester Domestic Science College. She did voluntary work with the 'Women's Voluntary Reserve' in the First World War but did no paid work as she seems to have suffered lifelong poor health. In an interview conducted by Professor Brian Harrison, c.1974, Winifred was thought to be well into her eighties. In the interview she described her family background. All seven sisters went to school (several boarding schools are specified) and to college. She also recalled selling Votes for Women standing in the gutter on Finchley Road, near John Barnes store and stewarding at large Women's Social & Political Union (WSPU) meetings. She claimed to have brought hot dinners (cooked at home in Hampstead) to Mrs Pankhurst, hiding out in the WSPU office at Lincolns Inn. They were smuggled in under the noses of the police. Her eldest sister, Muriel, a doctor, was imprisoned as part of the suffrage protests. Ethel, a PE specialist, was apparently good at helping to hide Mrs Pankhurst, who apparently looked like 'Dresden China'.",

The foundation stone was laid on 5 September 1751 on a site at Forth Banks given by Newcastle Corporation. As an interim measure until the hospital could be completed, a house was let in Gallowgate in May 1751 for the reception of patients. This contained 23 beds which soon had maximum occupancy and so rooms in adjoining houses had to be hired to meet the demand for admission. The Infirmary was ready for the reception of patients in October 1753. By 1896 it was generally agreed that the Infirmary was too overcrowded and instead of extending the building at Forth Banks, it was decided to build a new hospital on the Leazes to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Money for this was raised again by public subscription John Hall, who died in June 1899, bequethed \u00a3100,000 on the understanding that the public subscription should raise another \u00a3100,000 which it soon did. Designs by Messrs. W.L. Newcomb and Percy Adams were accepted and a contract for building the hospital for a sum of \u00a3203,527 was entered into. In 1901 Mr. Watson Armstrong and his wife donated a further \u00a3100,000 in memory of Lord Armstrong. The foundation stone was laid by the Prince of Wales on 20 June 1900 and he, as King Edward VII, also opened the Royal Victoria Infirmary on 11 July 1906.",

She spent much of her later childhood living with her aunt, and grandmother (both called Amelia Nicholls) following the death of her father in 1870, as her mother was unable to support six children. Amelia Scott and her three sisters all remained unmarried and Amelia and her sister Louise lived together in Tunbridge Wells for many years. Their background was one of a middle class family who were not quite as affluent as they once had been. Amelia Scott was involved in several organisations such as the Tunbridge Wells branch of the National Council of Women (originally called the National Union of Women Workers), which she established in May 1895. She was a member of this organisation for thirty-five years, serving as its honorary secretary. She worked as Treasurer for the Tunbridge Wells branch of the Women Citizens' Association and as an honorary secretary and Chair for the Leisure Hours Club - an association set up for working girls. She was also involved with the Tunbridge Wells branch of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, serving as vice president, and the Christian Social Union. Between 1918-1924 Amelia served on the Legal sub committee of the National Council for the Unmarried Mother and her Child. She also served on the Provisional Executive Committee of this organisation by representing the National Council of Women. Amelia Scott was also a Poor Law Guardian for many years, Chair of the Infant Life Protection Committee, Member of the Kent County Mental Deficiency Committee and Director of the Women's Common Lodging House Company, Tunbridge Wells. Amelia Scott was the author of 'Women of Sacred History', a study concerned with the women of the bible and 'Passing of a Great Dread', a history of the poor law as well as writing a number of articles, pamphlets and speeches for the organisations she was involved in.\nArrangement: The papers had been stored in a garage before transfer to the archive and there was no apparent order to them. Therefore the papers have been arranged into five sub fonds relating to different aspects of Amelia Scott's life but do not reflect original order. The sub-fonds are: a) Writings b) Involvement with organisations c) Work in the community d) Interest in women's issues e) Personal papers There are also two 'stand-alone' series of Family Papers and Correspondence\nPhysical condition: The papers are in a fairly good state of repair. Some spotting has occurred, as the papers were originally stored in a garage.",

        "Title": "Carroll Papers",
        "Description": "Correspondence, music, photographs and other items accumulated or created by members of the Carroll family - chiefly Walter and Ida Carroll, but also Elsa Carroll and Geoffrey Griffiths.\nAdministrative history: Walter Carroll, the sixth child and only son of Walter (b.1858) an upholsterer and Fanny W. (b.1832), was born in 1869. Working hard to escape his humble beginnings he was the first person to gain the DMus by examination at the Victoria University of Manchester, taking other degrees at Durham University. He held several posts at the University of Manchester and at the Royal Manchester College of Music, delivering the first lecture on the opening of the latter institution in 1893. He became the first Professor in the Art and Practice of Teaching at the RMCM, resigning in 1918 to become Manchester's first \u00c2\u00adMusic Adviser (part-time from 1918, full\u00c2\u00adtime from 1920, retiring in 1934). Carroll appointed six full-time peripatetic specialists over the period 1919 to 1928 to give music appreciation classes in the elementary schools, and also ran extremely popular out-of-\u00c2\u00adhours Training Courses in Music for the 'all-subjects' teachers in the elementary schools (1918-1934). Virtually every practising teacher attended at least one year of the three year course. In 1925 he also produced a best-selling Handbook of Music that ran to 10,000 copies in three editions that were widely distributed at home and abroad. It is however his music for children, written originally for his daughters Elsa and Ida, which is Carroll's claim to enduring fame. The key to its success was that children could play a harmonised tune before they could even read music properly (or at all) by singing or reciting the printed tunes to the words of a short header poem that scanned exactly with the rhythms of the music as they simultaneously discovered how to play it. After Scenes at a Farm, published by Forsyth Brothers Ltd in 1912, came all the other sets over a period of forty one years. These included The Countryside (1912), Sea Idylls (1914), Forest Fantasies (1916), Water Sprites (1923), and River and Rainbow (1933). All had exquisite cover illustrations by hand-picked, internationally renowned artists who unerringly matched their work to Carroll's titles and music: among them were W Heath Robinson, Arthur Rackham and Charles Folkard. The uniqueness of Carroll's brilliant idea was to fire the child's imagination by uniting what he called the Sister Arts: by simultaneously stimulating the child visually and poetically as well as musically. Many of his works are still in print. Carroll also held various posts as Choirmaster and Organist, most notably at St. James, Birch-in-Rusholme, Manchester, from 1916 until 1938. He married Gertrude A. Southam (1868-1958) in 1896, and they had two daughters, Elsa and Ida. Walter Carroll died in 1955, and a memorial window was placed in the Musicians Chapel, St Sepulchre without Newgate, in 1958. His wife Gertrude is commemorated with a shelter and seat in Portpatrick, where the family spent many of their holidays. Elsa Mary Carroll, the eldest daughter of Walter and Gertrude, was born in 1898, and attended the Manchester High School for Girls. On leaving school she became a clerk with the Northern Universities Joint Matriculation Board where she worked until her retirement. She was however best known in the area for founding the 1st Withington Girl Guide Company (in 1918) which she led until her retirement in 1974. 1st Withington was notable for its support of local elderly people, a cause dear to Elsa Carroll's heart as she worked as a volunteer for the Abbeyfield Society, presenting it with the house next-door to the Carroll family's in Lapwing Lane. In 1979 she was awarded the MBE. Elsa Carroll died in 1993. Ida Gertrude Carroll, youngest daughter of Walter and Gertrude, was born in 1905. Like her sister she attended the Manchester High School for Girls, and also the Matthay School of Music, becoming its Secretary. After the death of the founding Principal in 1956 Ida Carroll was appointed Acting Principal, becoming Principal in 1958. On the opening of the (Royal) Northern College of Music following the amalgamation of the Northern School with the Royal Manchester College of Music, Ida Carroll became Dean of Management, retiring in 1976. That same year she was elected president of the Incorporated Society of Musicians (the second woman to hold the post). She was awarded the OBE in 1964. In addition to her full-time work Ida Carroll was a freelance double bass player, and a leading figure in a number of organisations including Chetham's School of Music, European String Teachers Association and the National Youth Orchestra. Although she never married, Ida Carroll was lifelong companion of Geoffrey Griffiths, Bursar at the Northern School of Music. Ida Carroll died in 1995.\nArrangement: On the death of Ida Carroll, the last surviving member of the family, in 1995 the family home 117 Lapwing Lane, Didsbury was cleared by her executors. Original order was impossible to ascertain for the majority of the papers, although a few items were filed in drawers or otherwise organised. An arrangement has therefore been imposed, retaining where possible any discernible original order. The papers have been divided into four subfonds (in some cases such attribution has been made by a 'best guess'): WC - papers accumulated and created by Walter Carroll; EMC - papers accumulated and created by Elsa Carroll; IGC - papers accumulated and created by Ida Carroll; Family - papers and other items accumulated collectively by the family.\nPhysical condition: The majority of the fonds is on paper, with a large number of photographs. Most items are in a good condition.",

It includes records of 'side by side projects', 'our Industrial Heritage, Tinplaters of Lydney and Lydbrook, Excavations at Whitecross Manor House, Wynter family history, miscellaneous, Photography\nAdministrative history: The School took part in and developed the 'Side by Side' scheme promoted by the charity 'Help the Aged' bringing old and young together so successfully that in 1988 the charity asked that Whitecross's activities should be used as case studies for a tutor's manual being produced for use in schools. Between the years 1982 and 1986 the pupils produced 'Forest Memories Side by Side at Whitecross School, Lydney' which was professionally extended and entitled 'Lessons of a Lifetime' and funded by the Friends of Whitecross School. A second publication 'The Tinplaters of Lydney and Lydbrook' followed with sponsorship from Lydney Council of \u00a3500. Both books sold well and loans were repaid within two years. With \u00a3500 funding from the Schools Curriculum Development Committee a different type of project began with the excavation of a 17th century iron furnace complex in the School grounds which had once formed part of the Wynter estate. This led to 'Wyntours of the White Cross, an extended family history', being published in December 1986. The material collected was so extensive that the history was followed in 1988 by a supplementary work, 'The Wynter Family, a Collective Research'. Various awards have been given to the children for their efforts including the National Westminister Bank Project Responses \u00a3100, Help the Aged 'Side by Side Project' \u00a3500 (National First Prize) and Kodak Conservation Award, \u00a3100 for heritage conservation. Brian Rendell, project master of the Independent Learning Centre at Whitecross School, guided the research through and co-ordinated the projects helped in the early days by Keith Childs\nArrangement: Inspite of a certain amount of overlapping the collection has been arranged according to project. It includes typescripts of individual reminiscences, of papers written for other purposes but which have relevance to one of these projects, press cuttings, photographs and pedigrees both from printed sources and private compilations. It has been difficult to fit the material into neat and tidy categories. Items of particular interest have been noted in the catalogue in subject rather than date order.",

Reports that George and Mia's children are well [Hetha b.1896 and Horace b. 1898] She expresses her dislike of 'Hell-fire' or 'Terrorist' preachers and relates how poor Catherine Booth is under 'the black displeasure of her father, General Booth' and 'almost expelled from the Salvation Army' because in her preaching she will have nothing to do with terror. She has had a cheerful letter from Con [Constance, sister of Rhoda Butler and daughter of Emily (youngest sister of JB) by her second husband, Jasper Bolton. Con married Dr Frank Hudson] She has received a number of letters from abroad and at home thanking her for taking up the cause of Finland in her Periodical 'Storm Bell' [The Feb Manifesto of Feb 1899 issued by the Russians virtually abrogated the legislative power of the Finnish diet] She is sending her a photograph of a picture of Marie Griffin [her great niece, daughter of Edith Leupold] taken by the famous Italian sculptor Jerracci.\nAdministrative history: 30 Mar [1899] 'I have not seen or heard of the Milfield people at all.' Milfield was the original home of the Grey family, i.e. John Grey and his wife Hannah, where 3 sons and 5 daughters were born (10 children altogether). They moved to Dilston in 1833 when Josephine was the 7th child, and youngest daughter Emily Georgina was born at Dilston in 1836. The Milfield property was taken over by George Annett Grey (1815-1886) the eldest of the family. He married Elizabeth Boyd in 1878 and had a family of 2 sons and 4 daughters. The 2nd son, George Grey (1851-1915) took over Milfield and married Christian Margaret, daughter and heiress of George Grey of Middle Ord, and had 7 children. It would be the last mentioned family that JB would be referring to. 'George, Mia and Hetha came yesterday.' George was JB's eldest son, living since is retirement from the Civil Service in 1896 on his wife's estate, Ewart Park, Northumberland. At that date [1899] George and Mia had two children, Hetha born 26 Jul 1896 and Horace born 21 Jan 1898. 'I sympathise with poor Catherine Booth, when I saw her in Brussels. She is almost expelled from the Salvation Army and is under the black displeasure of her father, General Booth, because in all her meetings she preaches only the love of God and of Christ and will have nothing to do with terror..'

Constance married Dr Frank Hodson and they had 3 children.' 'Taking up the cause of Finland, in my little 'Storm Bell'. The Feb manifesto (15 Feb 1899) virtually abrogated the legislation power of the Finnish diet and the country was gradually taken over by Russian officials.

        "Description": "The collection documents Kate Adie\u2019s life, from her childhood and student life, to her career in local radio and broadcast journalism for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) covering major world events and conflicts, then on into her work as an author, public speaker and supporter of charitable causes. It includes recordings of her work, reporter\u2019s notebooks, correspondence, research notes and published works, speeches and talks, photographs and news cuttings, as well as souvenirs and collected objects.\nAdministrative history: Kate Adie was born in Whitley Bay, Northumberland in 1945. She was adopted as a baby by pharmacist, John Wilfrid Adie and his wife Maud, and was raised in Sunderland. She established contact with her birth mother, Babe Dunnet, and her family from 1993 onwards. Adie was educated at Hendon Hill Preparatory School and Sunderland Church High School, and was a member of the National Youth Theatre. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Scandinavian Studies from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1967. Kate Adie\u2019s career with the BBC began in local radio as a station assistant at BBC Radio Durham in 1968, followed by a move to BBC Radio Bristol, and time as a reporter for regional television news in Plymouth, Southampton and Brighton, before joining the BBC\u2019s national news team in 1978/9. After coming to wider public notice for her live coverage of the Iranian Embassy siege in 1980, Adie become known for reporting on disasters, conflicts and major global events, such as the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the US bombing of Libya in 1986, and the Tiananmen Square protests and massacre in Beijing, China in 1989. She was Chief News Correspondent for BBC News between 1989 and 2003, during which time she continued to report from combat zones, including the 1990 - 1991 Gulf War and the Yugoslav Wars. Kate Adie retired from her salaried role with the BBC in early 2003, continuing to work as a freelance writer, speaker, presenter and journalist, including presenting From Our Own Correspondent on BBC Radio 4. She is the author of five books: The Kindness of Strangers (2002), Corsets to Camouflage (2003), Nobody's Child (2005), Into Danger (2008), Fighting on the Home Front (2013). She is active in charitable work, having served as a trustee of the Imperial War Museum and the Sunderland Association Football Club Foundation, and as an ambassador for SSAFA, the UK\u2019s oldest military charity, and for the Prince\u2019s Trust. Kate Adie was appointed OBE in 1993 and CBE in 2018, and has received numerous professional acolades, including a BAFTA Fellowship, and honorary degrees and fellowships from a number of UK universities.\nArrangement: This is a personal archive that reflects a multi-faceted life. This is particularly evident in a broadly chronological series of correspondence files that forms the spine of the collection, in which BBC assignments sit alongside fan letters, charity commitments, and ephemera from places visited. Arrangement by document type has been introduced where no other evidence of original order can be found.",

        "Description": "'I have just heard from Maynard Wemys that he will be glad to see me on Monday in next week but has to go to Town on Tuesday returning that night. I think under those circumstances I shall certainly get home on Wednesday evening in next week. I wonder whether you will be able to see Rich on Wednesday? He said he should get home on Tuesday. The house itself that he has built is very pretty - not so 'bizarre' as much of Salters work - and most comfortably arranged. You go into the house, into a large hall which runs through the width of the house and by a large window on the further end opposite the door - commands the lovely view I told you about - there is a balcony all round on this floor in front and owing to the very steep fall of the hill the ground floor on which you enter at the back becomes the first floor in front - and this balcony is about 15 ft. above the ground then on the right of the hall there is a little dining room and on the left a drawing room with one of those pretty corner niches commanding such a lovely view. The offices are below the floor of the hall and drawing room but owing to the steep slope of the hill they have their windows like those of an ordinary ground floor and are very good. The whole of the servants part shuts off well from the quality part. There is a nice back stairs and the pantry has a lift to bring every thing up from the kitchen. It is all most 'nattily' arranged and I think the doctor is very pleased with it. Tell Joan I went to church 3 times yesterday and wore hood and surplice and sat in the reading clerk with the choir and read the lessons. I was so unused now to surplice and hood that I got into difficulties with finding my eye glass - so ended in reading the wrong 1st lesson, but Gray did not mind and no one else in the church knew it I think. This morning a slight shower of rain and not so hot - I hope you have some rain at home. I want to know how poor 'Saxe' is going on. If damp cool weather comes I should be very careful of him and only let him run in the Brew house. Tell Joan I have ordered her sketching water bottle to be sent to her from the A[rmy] & N[avy]. Mrs. Gray has given me [a] photograph of her little Mildred which gives some idea of the child but the real beauty is the fair skin and colouring and the bright almost penetrating look of clear gray eyes under eyebrows like yours in shape, 'high class' you know. The child certainly is very pretty, rather of the thin oesthetic [sic] type - favoured of stained church windows. Their eldest little boy 'Audley' is at home with a sore throat and is a prisoner upstairs poor little fellow. He is a dear serious little chap. The second boy Phillip is at school. I am enjoying myself very much - Gray sends you his very kindest regards and says he wishes you were here.' Includes drawing of ground floor of Wemys' house. (106/83)",

It transferred to premises in Pembroke Place in October 1845. By the middle of the century new but smaller premises were needed and a new hospital was built in Myrtle Street, opened in July 1862. At this period there also existed in Liverpool, the Ladies' Charity. This had been set up in 1796 with the object of alleviating the suffering of poor families by various means, including the provision of a midwife and where necessary, a doctor. By 1832 the Charity was described as being '. supported by subscription for the relief of poor married women in childbed at their own houses' (see Gore's Directory of Liverpool, 1932, Appendix, p. 96). The Ladies' Charity divided the town into districts, each district having its own midwife and accoucheur. During the 1860's it came to be felt that the Ladies' Charity and Lying-in Hospital should be united and in February 1869 the amalgamation of the two bodies was finally agreed. Thereafter the hospital was known as the Ladies' Charity and Lying-in Hospital. After much dispute in the period 1879 - 1882 the gynaecological and maternity functions of the Hospital were separated and a new Lying-in (maternity) Hospital was erected on a site at the corner of Brownlow Hill and Brownlow Street. This was completed in November 1884 and opened to patients in February 1885. The hospital remained in these premises until its move to the present [1984] building in Oxford Street. The foundation stone of the Oxford Street hospital was laid in March 1924 and it was officially opened in September 1926. From this time onwards it has been known as the Liverpool Maternity Hospital. Further details of the organisation of the Lying-in Hospital (also the Ladies' Charity) and statistics for cases treated etc. are given in T.H. Bickerton A Medical History of Liverpool.. to the Year 1920, 1936, pp. 213 - 223.",

        "Context Description": "Holocaust Centre North (Holocaust Survivors' Friendship Association).",
        "Title": "Personal papers",
        "Description": "This sub-fonds contains 70 sets of personal papers from Holocaust survivors, their families and other associates, all of whom have a connection to the north of England. The majority were donated by and/or co-created with survivors and refugees who fled Nazi persecution and settled in West Yorkshire (for instance Leeds and Bradford) from the 1930s onwards. There are also personal papers relating to other places across the north, such as Manchester, Hull, Liverpool, Newcastle, Harrogate and Sheffield. A small number are not from survivors, for instance the Bradford Jewish Refugee Hostel institutional papers and the testimonies of army personnel who liberated Nazi concentration camps or were prisoners of war. The personal papers contain a mixture of eyewitness testimonies (oral, video, written), documents (e.g. passports, ID, certificates), correspondence, photographs, ephemera, objects (e.g. childhood toys, jewellery, ceremonial items, clothes), books and audio-visual material. Some include secondary research collated by the collection donors or by HSFA on behalf of them, notably copies of records from Arolsen Archives. The personal papers are a mixture of physical records (originals and/or copies), digital only (digitised and/or born-digital) or both. In some instances, materials such as photographs were received as a copy first (paper or scan) and in subsequent years the original was donated, or a better digitised copy was created; as a result there are duplications within the personal papers. There are original documents and photographs from at least the 1920s to the present day, with copies of material from the 1870s onwards. The bulk of the documents and photographs relate to the 1920s-1950s. The personal papers provide a compelling insight into topics such as: \u2022 Jewish life in pre-war Europe \u2022 Impact of the Nuremberg Laws and rising antisemitism \u2022 Emigration attempts and routes \u2022 Kindertransport and child refugees \u2022 Ghetto and camp experiences, slave labour \u2022 Internment as \u2018enemy aliens\u2019 in the UK and Canada \u2022 Liberation and displacement \u2022 Culture shock and assimilation \u2022 Faith and identity \u2022 Restitution and compensation claims \u2022 Post-war careers, relationships, social circles, hobbies \u2022 Educating about the Holocaust \u2022 Intergenerational relationships and trauma \u2022 Memorialisation, post-memory Administrative history of the collection The personal papers collection originated with the initiative of the \u2018Making A New Life\u2019 testimony project, a collaboration between HSFA and the University of Leeds from around 2004-2007. MANL was hosted in the University\u2019s CentreCATH (Cultural Analysis, Theory & History, see ) under the directorship of Professor Griselda Pollock, Professor of Social and Critical Histories of Art and Director of CentreCATH. MANL project staff included interviewers Dr Amanda Bergen and Bernice Shooman and archivist Brett Harrison. MANL interviews included discussion points such as: \u2018what the experience [of the Holocaust] did to faith and identity, what memories remain from childhood and what has been remade, what connections were forged with British society, with Jewish and other faith communities, what social projects and personal interests helped to make a new life across the breach\u2019 (MANL press article, University of Leeds website, 2007). Staff also gathered press cuttings, obituaries and other secondary research about first-generation survivors in Yorkshire to document their contributions to society. The success of MANL was followed by three similar projects whose outputs included creating audio or video testimony with survivors of Nazi persecution: \u2018Building Bridges' (audio, 2007-2009), \u2018Educating the Educators' (video, 2009-2011) and \u2018Sustaining the Legacy\u2019 (videos, 2014-2015). Some participants gave interviews for multiple projects. Dr Tracy Craggs, now Head of Collections at Holocaust Centre North, joined as project interviewer in 2007 and has continuously conducted testimonies on behalf of HSFA ever since, both on a project basis and whenever opportunities arise for survivor involvement. The core research intent of these projects was to record the survivors\u2019 life stories from childhood to the present day. First- or second-generation Holocaust survivors, i.e. survivors or their children, who were living in or connected to the north of England (primarily Yorkshire at this point) were invited to record an interview with project staff and, in some cases, to donate original or scanned copies of family photos and documents. Whilst a lot of the material collected focusses on the period between 1930s \u2013 1940s, central to MANL and the subsequent projects was the aim of recording survivors\u2019 lives after persecution to document their experiences as immigrants in the north of England and the secondary effects of forced displacement and the Holocaust. Since the opening of HSFA\u2019s Centre in Huddersfield in 2018, collecting testimonies alongside documentary evidence of the Holocaust has become core to the charity\u2019s work and its geographic remit has expanded across the north of England. In 2022, MANL project papers and other HSFA records historically cared for by the University of Leeds Special Collections were transferred to the HSFA archive in Huddersfield. As per the earlier testimony projects, Holocaust Centre North continues to pro-actively seek eyewitness survivors to share their stories, but as this number decreases, its remit has widened to include more interviews with second- and third-generation survivors as well as intergenerational testimonies; such material not only contains the life stories of eyewitnesses but also illuminates our understanding of the continuing repercussions of the Holocaust for survivor families and society.

Norwood was first awarded Royal Patronage in 1815 when Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex bestowed his Royal Patronage on the Jew's Hospital having admired the work of the charity in caring for Jewish children from poor backgrounds. The charity has had the honour of receiving Royal Patronage from every monarch since, from King Edward VII to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. The collection includes letters from our Royal patrons confirming their ongoing patronage of the charity as well as records from visits made by the Royal family. There is a large collection of photographs dating from 1900s to the present day that reflect how Norwood has evolved over time and developed into the charity it is recognised as today. Similarly, the collection includes artefacts collected from the Orphanage as well as memorabilia from Norwood events. The papers of the Norwood Old Scholars Association (NOSA) is another feature of the collection. The Association is a charity which helps ex-Norwood children who lived in the Norwood Orphanage or family homes stay in contact with one another. It provides relief to those in need and offers the chance for classmates to reconnect through the Association\u2019s reunions. Their papers include NOSA newsletters that feature many stories from ex-students who went to the Orphanage and there are also committee minutes and memorabilia from NOSA events.\nAdministrative history: Norwood is a Jewish charity that cares for children, families and adults with learning disabilities. It developed from two different institutions: The Jews\u2019 Hospital and Orphan Asylum (previously two separate institutions), Norwood Homes for Jewish Children, Norwood Child Care, The Ravenswood Foundation and Norwood Ravenswood. The Jews\u2019 Hospital The Jews\u2019 Hospital was established by two Jewish brothers, Abraham and Benjamin Goldsmid. The hospital was a charitable institution that cared for the sick, the elderly, the destitute and the young. It was established in 1807 at Mile End in London where it taught children Jewish religious studies and how to read and write. The hospital was patronised by Augustus Frederick (1773-1843), Duke of Sussex from 1815 and then George William Frederick Charles (1819-1904), Duke of Cambridge after 1843. Due to overcrowding and dilapidation the Jew\u2019s Hospital moved to new premises in West Norwood, donated by philanthropists Barnett and Isabella Meyers. The Jew\u2019s Orphan Asylum The Jew\u2019s Orphan Asylum originated in 1831 and its purpose was to care for the general wellbeing and education of Jewish children who were deprived of both parents and (for a limited number) those with only one parent. It was originally located in Leman Street, London but due to increasing numbers moved to Tenter Ground at Goodman\u2019s Fields in 1841. Like the Jews\u2019 Hospital, the asylum also received Royal Patronage from; Edward VII (1841-1910) King of Great Britain and Ireland [when he was Prince of Wales], Adelaide (1792-1849) Queen Consort of William IV, King of England, and Victoria (1786-1861), Duchess of Kent. The Jews\u2019 Hospital and Orphan Asylum The Jews\u2019 Hospital and the Jew\u2019s Orphan Asylum amalgamated in 1876 to become the \u2018Jews\u2019 Hospital and Orphan Asylum\u2019. A merger had been suggested as early as 1856 but was but was rejected on the grounds that the two institutions had different rationale. However, by the 1870s the both charities were struggling financially and so merged with another. Dr. Henry Behrend was the first President of the new institution and tirelessly oversaw the extensions of the building so that more children could be accommodated. The Centenary Hall where the children ate was inaugurated by George (1819-1904), Duke of Cambridge and by 1911 Norwood was able to care for at least 400 children. Between 1908 and 1911 the Arnold and Jane Gabriel Home was built on the grounds of Norwood to cater for children between the ages of five and eight. After the Second World War two further residential homes, Samuel and Stephany House were built within the grounds in 1957. By 1961 Norwood had acquired nine houses in the neighbouring streets. Each home had a small group of boys and girls residing in them and they lived as a family group with their houseparent\u2019s. The Family Houses were tied to the main institution but became more independent as time progressed. After the war children were no longer educated at the main institution, instead attending local schools for their education and living at the Norwood family homes. Norwood Homes for Jewish Children The main Victorian building belonging to Norwood was demolished in the 1960s and a new synagogue and assembly hall built in its place. By this period Norwood had shifted its policy to more community-based services considering that it no longer had the financial outlay of maintaining a large-scale institution, it became known as \u2018Norwood Homes for Jewish Children.\u2019 In 1967 it incorporated the child welfare services previously provided by the Jewish Welfare Board assuming responsibility for the Highbury House Babies\u2019 Home and a hostel for unmarried mothers. However, as more help was made available to struggling families, generally fewer children took advantage of the service provided by the Norwood family homes and the last home closed in 1992. Norwood Child Care In the 1970\u2019s Norwood Homes extended its activities into the field of disability and worked both independently and in partnership with a number of specialist organisations namely the Ravenswood Foundation. In 1982 Norwood Homes for Jewish Children changed its name to \u2018Norwood Child Care.\u2019 The Ravenswood Foundation Ravenswood was initially founded by the Jewish Association to Aid Backward Children in 1951. The association was set up by four sets of parents who had children with disabilities; their aim was to provide these children with education and residential care. Initially the school only accommodated boys and girls under the age of 15 but in 1958 the association opened Avenue House in Wokingham for the housing and training of boys over the age of 15. In 1959 they also bought 112 acres of farmland at Ravenswood which opened in 1964 and is known today as Ravenswood Village. As Ravenswood developed, a board of trustees known as the Ravenswood Foundation was established to administer the Ravenswood establishment. The foundation was supported and maintained financially by a network of aid societies called the National Association of Friends of Ravenswood and much like the Orphan Aid Societies for Norwood, raised funds for the foundation so that the trustees could run the institution. Ravenswood provides residential and life long learning services where it helps to develop independence through life skills courses and employment services. It was the first institution to introduce charity bike rides as a fundraising method and it set the precedent in 1992 with the first Biblical Cycle Ride from Dan to Beersheba, Israel. Norwood Ravenswood After having worked with Ravenswood on a number of projects the two charities, Norwood Child Care and the Ravenswood Foundation, eventually merged in 1996 becoming Norwood Ravenswood and becoming the charity it is recognised as today, Norwood.\nArrangement: The constant accrual of records over a long period of time without any formal assessment on their entry into the archive has meant that the original order of much of the collection has been lost. The collection has been catalogued using ISAD(G) and the arrangement has been carried out taking a number of considerations into account: - the basic archival principal of provenance and original order, where this is Identifiable (Who created these records?

        "Description": "Records of Eynsham Park Estate\nAdministrative history: The Eynsham Park Estate was acquired in the eighteen-seventies by James Mason, a mining engineer born in 1824. According to his grandson, Michael H. Mason, he was the natural son of a well-known family but was brought up as the elder child of the widow of an architect whose name he took. James Mason, then living in Essex, attended the University of Paris and was apparently still there during the revolution of 1848. Soon afterwards, he became the manager of some iron mines near Bilbao in Spain. Here he learned of derelict copper mines in southern Spain, previously worked by the Romans. He visited the mines and also those across the border in Portugal. Eventually he obtained a concession to work the Sao Domingos mine from the Portuguese government in partnership with a friend named Barry. The mine remained in their possession until the 1880s. Using his engineering knowledge to design pumping machines and equipment for the mines railway system, he turned the mine into a profitable undertaking. His partner, Barry, organised the shipping and marketing while Mason took personal charge of the mine, where he remained until 1879 when his only son succeeded him. The mine produced iron and sulphur as well as copper which later became only a valuable by-product. By 1865 Mason had accumulated a considerable fortune which increased still further during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, when the demand for iron, sulphur and copper rose sharply. Mason had already then purchased part of Eynsham Park Estate, Witney, Oxon, with the intention of pursuing agricultural experiments. His grandson claims that mining was for James Mason simply a means to his becoming a landowner. Soil research, the chemistry of plants and general scientific agriculture interested him greatly. At its largest the property occupied about 10,000 acres. He planted many new trees of foreign origin on the estate and designed an artificial lake for irrigation and a domestic water supply. James Mason died in 1903 when his only son was 42 years old. The son had little interest in farming and gradually sold parts of the estate not required for game shooting. After his death in 1929 his son Michael Mason developed the estate by improving the livestock and the woodlands. During the Second World War, while Michael Mason served in the Royal Navy his wife took charge of the estate, which the government requisitioned for war purposes. It provided space or accommodation for two hospitals, a home for the blind, several army camps and other units. After 1945 Michael Mason sold two farms on the estate to tenants and two to a neighbouring landowner, thus consolidating his property into a single area. Mrs. Michael Mason built up pedigree herd of Aberdeen Angus cattle which became very well-known but after her death her husband sold the herd.\nArrangement: 1 CORRESPONDENCE 2 BOOKS OF ACCOUNT 3 CATALOGUES 4 CROP BOOKS 5 DEEDS AND AGREEMENTS 6 DIARIES AND JOURNALS 7 HERD BOOKS 8 INVENTORIES 9 NEWSPAPER CUTTINGS 10 NOTE BOOKS 11 PHOTOGRAPHS 12 REGISTERS 13 VALUATIONS 14 PRINTED MATERIAL 15 SUNDRY PAPERS 16 MAPS AND PLANS",

        "Title": "Diaries of cycle-tours undertaken by Herbert Burrell and Aruthur Winton",
        "Description": "These diaries were given by Herbert Burrell's daughter; his friend Arthur Winton's diaries seem to have been given to him after Winton's emigration to Canada Herbert's diaries extend at least as far as the second war and include coach-tours; Arthur's relate exclusively to bicycle expeditions and end with the narrative of his emigration-voyage in 1910 Herbert Isaac Burrell was born in Brighton on 6 December 1883, the son of James Haffenden Burrell of 46 Islingword Road, a newspaper reporter, and his wife Lucy Jane, n\u00e9e Fulbrooke. When he was 12 his father was transferred to Eastbourne. Arthur's first recorded tour on 27 February 1904 was in Burrell's company. Burrell records that 'in 1906 Art and I commenced to extend our travels to other parts of the kingdom'; these tours are chronicled in both Herbert's retrospective volumes and Art's contemporary ones. 'For some unknown reason Art took a dislike to cycling and definitely gave it up and later went to Canada'; Herbert's own cycling began to wain, owing to a lack of congenial companionship and the growth of other interests. In 1914 he married Eleanor Dorothy Josephine Suhr, and undertook what must have been the first of many coach-tours as a deferred honeymoon in 1916. The donor, their only child, was born in 1918 Herbert pursued a career as a local government officer in the finance department of Eastbourne Borough Council, where he was already employed in 1909. He was deputy borough treasurer at the outbreak of war in 1914, acted as borough treasurer until 1919, and was promoted to that post permanently in 1942. He seems to have been a regular attender at conferences, providing opportunities for visits to the localities of Scarborough in 1930, Buxton in 1934, Blackpool in 1936 and Edinburgh in 1940. He retired on grounds of ill-health in 1944 The Burrells lived at Briardene, 53 Victoria Drive, Eastbourne, from before 1939 until 1949, when they moved to Haslemere. In 1952 they moved to The Bungalow, Cranston Road, East Grinstead The two series are quite different in their approach. Herbert's diaries were compiled retrospectively, and amply illustrated with postcards, photographs and cuttings from commercial publications; there are also several pencil sketches, presumably by Herbert himself. The text concentrates on the history and folklore of the locations, and contains little about contemporary events. Arthur's diaries seem to have been compiled shortly after the end of each tour. They are illustrated only with meticulous route-plans, and the text, sparing on the localities visited, is an almost exclusively cyclist's-eye-view of the expedition. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, on his emigration, Arthur gave his diaries to Herbert, who was inspired by them to produce his own version, possibly during the second war when long-distance cycling was impossible Once his volumes had been compiled, Herbert augmented them by further cuttings, mostly from Sussex County Magazine but also with his own pencil sketches. The published material has not been retained, but the sketches and other inserted material are listed as AMS6442/10-14. The volumes are individually indexed, and a general index volume (AMS6442/9) was also compiled Art and his wife Jean visited Mr and Mrs Burrell in 1950 and 1951; he died in September 1959",

        "Title": "MANOR GARDENS CENTRE",
        "Description": "The collection has been arranged with committee minutes first, followed by more general administration such as correspondence, notes, press cuttings and reports. There are many photographs of children, nurses and buildings and one roll of plans\nAdministrative history: The North Islington Infant Welfare Centre and School for Mothers was founded in 1913 by Mrs A.M. Keen. In some ways a pioneer in infant welfare work, she succeeded in opening one room at the Mission Hall, Elthorne Road and obtained the services of Doctor Vance Knox and Doctor Campbell Maxwell. With herself as honorary secretary and treasurer, and with the help of one nurse the school began with only 9 mothers but by 1920 the number of attendances had risen to over 12,000. In Islington at the time the infant mortality rate was 110 per 1000 births. The stated aim of the centre was to prevent disease and death among women and children by educating the mother. The first mothers were able to buy clothing and medicines, have their babies weighed and examined by the medical officer. Apparently in the early days Mrs Keen herself would stand outside and stop passing mothers with babies in order to persuade them to attend the clinics. It soon became clear that larger and more suitable permanent premises were needed, and in 1915 number 9 Manor Gardens was rented, two years later, such was the demand for the centre's services, that another house, number 8, was taken over. By degrees Mrs Keen developed the centre in a variety of ways, and soon there were dental clinics, massage, an 'artificial sunlight treatment' clinic, training for infant welfare students and LCC scholarship pupils, the provision of home helps, a flourishing fathers and mothers committee, sewing classes for mothers, and in 1917, with the support of the American Women's Club and the American Red Cross, four wards were set up in numbers 6 and 7 Manor Gardens, so that children who were not thriving could be taken in and could have special attention. In 1919 Lady Crosfield, wife of Sir Arthur Crossfield, at one time Member of Parliament for Warrington and later chairman of the National Playing Fields Association, took over as chairman. And in 1922 the Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother) agreed to be its patron. During the Second World War, the wards were closed down and part of the centre was taken over by Islington Borough Council as a Stretcher Party Depot and First Aid Post. After the war, and under the National Health Service, local health services in Islington (including those for maternity and child welfare) were transferred from the Borough to the London County Council. Lady Crossfield managed to persuade the Minister of Health, Aneurin Bevan that the centre should retain its individuality, and the committee should retain responsibility for its daily work. The centre had remained for its first 50 years primarily what it had set out to be - a service for promoting the health of mothers and babies, but the inception of the NHS led the centre to take a wider view of the health needs of the community. Thus in 1950 the centre opened a playgroup. The 1960's saw the start of Family Planning and Marriage Guidance Counselling services and the introduction of Geriatric Health visitors. By the 1970's however, the local population had fallen and the numbers of mothers and babies attending began to decline. The wards, which had done such vital, life-saving work were no longer needed and were closed down in 1973. In the 1980's the need for revitalisation and further expansion became evident and the building was steadily refurbished. By the time of the centre's 70th anniversary in 1983, it had been renamed the 'Manor Gardens Centre' and was open seven days a week. In addition to the child health centre, maternity and playschool facilities, new services for young people and the elderly, the fit and the disabled, those living in the community and those from further afield had been set up. Some 4,000 people were now using the centre each week. In 1985, however, the Islington District Health Authority set in motion plans for a purpose built health centre to be based at the Royal Northern Hospital, with the intention that the community health services at the Manor Gardens Centre would be transferred there in the early 1990's. The space made available at the centre would be used to house a community mental health centre staffed by a range of health and social service workers. By the late 1990's, alongside its playgroup, the centre was running a variety of health and welfare services, with the aim as always to improve the quality of life of local people. Services included - a Homecare Scheme offering support to vulnerable people living on their own; a Stroke Project to help those who had had strokes get involved with a variety of rehabilitative, creative and social activities (including a weekly exercise session at Pentonville Prison); arts projects for young disabled people; a Befriending Scheme to provide practical support for local older and/or disabled people in their own homes; a Bengali and Turkish/Kurdish womens group; a lunch club; an Accident Prevention Loan scheme; and an advocacy project for asylum seekers; as well as acting as a meeting place for tenant groups and other local organisations.\nNote: Listed 10JAN2002 '",

Documents relating to Thomas Haynes Bayly, dramatist and lyricist (a) Literary Works (b) Correspondence (c) Family papers and albums\nAdministrative history: John King, who practised as a surgeon in Clifton for forty years at the beginning of the nineteenth century, came originally from Berne in Switzerland as Nicholas Johann Koenig. Several papers from his early life survive, including a pedigree of the Koenig family and an account of its place in the history of Berne, together with his Swiss freemason's apron and certificates. In England he settled in Bristol, working with Dr.Thomas Beddoes at his Pneumatic Institution in Dowry Square, where Humphry Davy was also an assistant. Several letters from Davy after he left Bristol are among King's correspondence. There is little trace of King's great interest in painting, though the City Art Gallery possess both pictures by him and portraits of him. There is evidence of his friendship with Robert Southey in letters from the poet's widow asking that she may have Southey's letters returned to her. King married Emmeline Edgeworth, sister of Dr.Beddoes' wife, by whom he had a son, Edgeworth, who died young, and two daughters, Zoe and Psyche Emmeline. Emmeline's eldest sister was the novelist, Maria Edgeworth, and there are several letters from her to her niece Zoe, and a collection of newspaper cuttings and articles about her. Zoe, who shared many of her father's interests, remained unmarried. She conducted the indefatigable correspondence of a Victorian lady, but her correspondents talk of little save the state of their health and the affairs of their friends. She also kept journals, albums, diaries and an obituary book, together with various printed poems, memoirs, newspaper cuttings etc. Zoe's sister, Emmeline, married Dr.William Gibbons, by whom she had three children, Elizabeth, Catherine and William Edgeworth. There are letters to Emmeline and her daughters, including some frommembers of the Edgeworth family, a Gibbons family pedigree and a large number of photographs. Thomas Haynes Bayly, whose name is little known today, was one of the most popular song-writers and poets of the 1820s and 1830s. Of good family, he was forced by financial misfortune to spend much of his time in France and support his family by writing. He published one full-length novel in three volumes called 'The Aylmers', and several volumes of poetry and prose, but his most consistent source of income came from his work for the stage, musical comedies and farces. His correspondence includes letters about his work from many of the leading theatrical managers and actors of the day, and from other writers and poets including Edward Lytton Bulwer, who was a close friend. After his early death in 1839, Bayly's widow, Helena, wrote a memoir of him to be included in a posthumous publication of some of his work. The collection also contains several of her albums and a volume of press-cuttings reviewing his work. Their only surviving child, Margaret, married William Edgeworth Gibbons, thus accounting for the presence of Bayly's papers among those of the Gibbons family; Bayly himself had no connection with Bristol and his correspondence is almost all from people in London. Margaret's children, Edgeworth and Helena both died unmarried and their branch of the Gibbons family died with them.",

        "Title": "S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi papers",
        "Description": "This collection contains the papers of S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi (1873-1933), a Hungarian psychoanalyst and close associate of Sigmund Freud. The collection spans the years from 1820 to about 1981, with the bulk of the material dating from 1899 to 1933. Many facets of Ferenczi's life and work are represented in the collection, including his early work as a medical doctor; the development of his interest in psychoanalysis; his meeting and friendship with Freud; his efforts to establish psychoanalysis in Hungary; and his own contributions to psychoanalytic theory and technique. Also reflected in the collection is Ferenczi's personal life, including papers related to his parents, Bern\u00e1t Fr\u00e4nkel and Rosa Eibensch\u00fctz; his siblings; his wife Gizella Ferenczi (n\u00e9e Altschule); and his stepdaughters Elma Laurvik (n\u00e9e P\u00e1los) and Magda Ferenczi. In addition to papers directly related to Ferenczi's life and work, many of the papers are related to the actions of Ferenczi's literary executors, principally Michael Balint, to propagate his work and secure his reputation after his death. The collection also reveals details of the impact of the political upheavals of the 20th century in Hungary, in relation to both the psychoanalytic movement and everyday life. The collection includes correspondence; family papers; photographs; official documents; manuscripts and transcriptions; unpublished drafts; notebooks; and published works. The majority of the papers are photocopies but many are originals, including Ferenczi's 1932 clinical diary.\nAdministrative history: S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi was a Hungarian neurologist, psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, and was one of Sigmund Freud's closest collaborators until their eventual estrangement. Born in 1873 in Miskolc, S\u00e1ndor was the eighth of the twelve children of Bern\u00e1t Fr\u00e4nkel and his wife Rosa, both Jews of Galician origin. He spent much of his upbringing in his father's bookshop. His father died when he was fifteen years old. After completing his schooling, he studied medicine at Vienna University, receiving his diploma in 1896. After graduating, he spent a year doing his military service before settling in Budapest, where he worked at various hospitals and, in 1900, opened a private practice, while continuing to work as a neurologist and psychiatrist and publishing regularly in Hungarian medical journals. In 1907, Ferenczi became acquainted with psychoanalysis and met Carl Jung. In 1908, he met Sigmund Freud, with whom he became a close collaborator and friend, and dedicated himself to the psychoanalytic movement. The following year he accompanied Freud and Jung on their trip to Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. From 1912 onwards, he was a member of the 'secret committee'. In 1913 he founded the Hungarian Psychoanalytic Association and coordinated the establishment of the International Psychoanalytic Association. He was intermittently analysed by Freud between 1914 and 1916. During the First World War, he served as a military surgeon, psychiatrist and neurologist in the Hungarian Army, where he used psychoanalysis in the treatment of shell-shocked soldiers, an experience which informed his subsequent ideas on trauma and phylogeny. In 1918, Ferenczi was elected president of the IPA, but was forced to relinquish the position due to the social and political unrest in Hungary. In 1919, after a long and complicated courtship, Ferenczi married Gizella Altschule, becoming the stepfather of her two children, Elma (whom he had also contemplated marrying) and Magda. Ferenczi's early psychoanalytic papers, including 'Introjection and Transference' (1909) and 'Stages in the Development of the Sense of Reality' (1913), marked him out as an innovator in psychoanalytic theory. From around 1919, he began to he began to develop what became known as 'active' technique, according to which the psychoanalyst plays a less passive, more emotive role in the analytic session, initially in order to cultivate transferential dynamics in patients whose treatments were stagnating. These technical innovations and subsequent ones, while initially supported by Freud, were vigorously opposed by the several prominent psychoanalysts who saw them as serious deviations from Freudian psychoanalysis, resulting in a growing rift between Ferenczi and the mainstream psychoanalytic community. Nonetheless, he continued to publish numerous papers: in 1924, with Freud's encouragement, he published 'Thalassa: A Theory of Genitality', in which he introduced the notion of 'bioanalysis'. Also in 1924, Ferenczi and Otto Rank published 'The Development of Psychoanalysis', which was strongly condemned by figures such as Ernest Jones and Karl Abraham, and subsequently by Freud himself. Ferenczi had developed a technique which sought to return to the patient the love that he or she had not received in childhood, leading him to endorse physical contact such as kissing and caressing, and 'mutual analysis' (examples of which he committed to his 1932 clinical diary). In 1926, Ferenczi travelled to America, where he lectured on psychoanalysis and conducted several analyses. Upon his return in 1927 his relationship with Freud, who increasingly expressed his disapproval of the direction of his psychoanalytic thinking and his interactions with patients, began to break down. In 1932, the year in which Ferenczi delivered his controversial paper on 'The Confusion of Tongues Between Adults and the Child', their friendship ended. Ferenczi died of pernicious anemia the following year. Principal sources: Aron, L. and A. Harris. 1993. 'The Legacy of S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi'. Hillsdale, New Jersey and London: The Analytic Press.

Shucksmith trained at the University of Leeds Medical School from 1927, beginning at age 17; he received first class honours after spending seven years training and won the Littlewood prize in anatomy which enabled him to take BSc in physiology, for which he also gained first class honours. He also won the Infirmary Scholarship, the McGill and Mayo Robson prizes in surgery, the Hardwick prize in clincial medicine and the William Hey Gold Medal in clinical surgery. After his studies ended Shucksmith immediately became house surgeon to E R Flint at Leeds General Infirmary. Prior to the Second World War, he and many other junior members of staff at the Infirmary joined the Territorial Army, and was posted to France (where he was evacuated from Dunkirk), Malta and Sicily. After discharge from the forces he became honorary assistant surgeon to the General Infirmary at Leeds and numerous hospitals in the area including St James's and Seacroft. In 1945 Shucksmith was appointed Hunterian Professor, taking as his theme 'abdominal injuries in battle casualties' (his paper on this topic is included in the collection). He wrote numerous articles on the topics of vascular surgery and breast cancer and recruited pathologists, experimental cancer researchers and radiotherapists in order to achieve results. Shucksmith died at St. James's Hospital in 1993. The collection consists of professional papers authored by Shucksmith during his career, personal papers (including Christmas cards) and papers relating to Shucksmith's visit to Malta in 1969 to unveil a plaque dedicated to Lord Moynihan.",

In November 1901 a meeting was held at 24 Park Lane, the London home of Lord and Lady Brassey of Normanhurst in Catsfield, to which delegates from most local nursing associations were invited. Its aim was to found a general county nursing association affiliated to the Queen Victoria Jubilee Institute, with a paid nursing superintendent, which could co-ordinate the voluntary local nursing associations, and train and supervise nurses in the county. The Sussex County Nursing Association was established in October 1902, and many local associations soon became affiliated The Midwives Act, 1902, had empowered local authorities to inspect and license midwives, and raise standards. The act was administered in East Sussex by the Public Health Committee of ESCC, which worked closely with the Sussex County Nursing Association, and granted nursing scholarships to train midwives. The Education (Administrative Provisions) Act, 1907, initiated a system of medical inspection of children attending public elementary schools. In October 1909 a scheme came into effect where the East Sussex Education Department paid district nurses for such inspections In 1918 the Sussex County Nursing Association was divided between East and West Sussex, because its work had grown and there were difficulties in dealing with two county authorities. The East Sussex Nursing Federation came into operation in April 1918 The Maternity and Child Welfare Act, 1918, made it a statutory duty for county and county boroughs to set up a committee for maternity and child welfare matters, which was empowered to take steps to safeguard the health of expectant mothers, and of children under five. The resulting East Sussex County Council Maternity and Child Welfare Committee also assumed the county council's functions under the Midwives Act of 1902. East Sussex County Council contracted the Sussex County Nursing Association, and later the East Sussex Nursing Federation, to carry out duties relating to midwifery, infant visiting and school nursing services (for agreements, 1916-1947, see AMS6583/15 below). The provision of a midwifery service was made compulsory under the Midwives Act, 1936 After the establishment of the National Health Service in 1948, East Sussex County Council exercised the discretion given by the National Health Service Act, 1946, and retained the East Sussex County Nursing Federation as its agent for the employment of district nurses, and the provision of a home nursing and midwifery service through the local district nursing associations. In 1949 it was agreed that its name should be changed to the East Sussex County Nursing Association, following a request from the Queen's Institute of District Nursing; East Sussex was the only county to delegate fully agency powers to such an association. The county council made a similar arrangement with the Hove and Portslade Nursing Association to cover the Borough of Hove and the Urban District of Portslade-by-Sea In 1947 the federation inaugurated a mobile Home Physiotherapy Service, which initially provided six vans, each in the charge of the trained physiotherapist, to provide treatment particularly in rural areas The Little Black Bag Housing Association was registered in November 1965 with the object of providing flatlets for the accommodation of retired nursing sisters. A site was obtained at the Holy Cross Convent, Bolnore Road, Haywards Heath, in 1970, and the flats were called Joan Nightingale House. The Little Black Bag Housing Association is now (2001) managed by the Eldon Housing Association, Purley The East Sussex Nursing Association was based at 27a High Street, Lewes from 1946 until 1968, when it moved to County Hall, Lewes. The association's clerical staff was then merged with that of the County Medical Officer of Health's Department. At a Special Meeting of the association on 19 May 1969, it was decided that the association would relinquish its delegated functions on behalf of ESCC from 31 Mar 1970 due to changing conditions in the health service and pending local government reorganisation. It would be reconstituted as a trust to carry on the work of the Pensions Fund, and continue welfare work for serving and retired nurses with the funds. In 1973 the registered office of the trust moved from County Hall to Joan Nightingale House, which is where these records used to be stored",

Aims: To promote a high and equal standard of morality and sexual responsibility for men and women in public opinion, law and practice; To secure the abolition of state regulation of prostitution, whatever form it may take, and to secure the suppression and the punishment of third party profiteering from prostitution (eg brothel-keeping, procuring); To examine existing or proposed legislation dealing with health (eg treatment of venereal disease) and public order (solicitation laws) and to oppose any laws or administrative regulations which are aimed at or may be applied to some particular section of the community; To study and promote such legislative, administrative, social, educational and hygienic reforms as will tend to encourage the highest public and private morality; To keep these principles continually before Government departments. Basic principles: social justice; equality of all citizens before the law; a single moral standard for men and women. It produced its own journal 'The Shield'. Origins of the Association: The Association for Moral and Social Hygiene was established in 1915 following the amalgamation of the Ladies' National Association and 'British Continental and General Federation for Abolition of Government Regulation of Prostitution' (which later became the International Abolitionist Federation). Josephine Butler founded the Ladies' National Association in the 1860s when she led her campaign against the Contagious Diseases Acts in Great Britain. These Acts applied to certain garrison towns and seaports, and attempted to preserve the health of servicemen by arrest and compulsory medical examination of women found within these areas who were suspected of being there for immoral purposes. The Acts were repealed in 1886. Josephine Butler also made contact with abolitionists in Europe and established the International Abolitionist Federation in Mar 1875. Work from 1915-1962: Sir Charles Tarring held the Chair at the first Executive Committee meeting on 5 Nov 1915. Helen Wilson was first honorary secretary and Alison Neilans, assistant secretary. Neilans later became General Secretary, a position she held until her death in 1942. Like its predecessors, the Association continued to oppose state regulation of prostitution. This was seen in its campaigns to repeal the provisions of the Defence of the Realm Acts in the First and Second World Wars (Sections 40D and 33B respectively), and against 'solicitation laws' by introducing Public Places (Order) Bills, Street Bills and Criminal Justice Bills between the 1920s and 1940s. It also made representations to the Wolfenden Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution 1954-1957 and was very critical of the Street Offences Act 1959, which was in part a product of the report emanating from that Committee. The Association became concerned with a wide range of issues relating to sexuality: for example, sex education, sex tourism, sexual offences and age of consent, traffic in women and children, and child prostitution. In 1962 the Association changed its name to the Josephine Butler Society. The Josephine Butler Society (1962-fl.2007) was formed in 1962 and was the renamed Association for Moral & Social Hygiene. Its objectives were: To promote a high and equal standard of morality and sexual responsibility for men and women in public opinion, law and practice; To promote the principles of the International Abolitionist Federation in order to secure the abolition of state regulation of prostitution, to combat the traffic in persons and to expose and prevent any form of exploitation of prostitution by third parties; To examine any existing or proposed legislation on matters associated with prostitution or related aspects of public order and to promote social, legal and administrative reforms in furtherance of the above objectives. Its basic principles were: social justice; equality of all citizens before the law; a single moral standard for men and women. (Taken from membership and donation form 1990). The Josephine Butler Society was a pressure group not a rescue organisation. It wished to prevent the exploitation of prostitutes and marginalisation of those who could be forced into this activity by poverty and abuse, and it believed these problems should be addressed by changes in the law. It believed that more should be done to prevent young people from drifting into prostitution, to help those who wished to leave it, and to rehabilitate its victims. Its work in the early 21st century took two main forms: to make representation to various departments of the UK Government on prostitution and related issues an; to liaise and network with other agencies both statutory and voluntary who worked in related areas. Josephine Elizabeth Butler [n\u00e9e Grey](1828-1906) was born on 13 Apr 1828 (7th of 10 children of John Grey and Hannah n\u00e9e Annett). In 1835 the Grey family moved to Dilston near Corbridge, Northumberland after her father's appointment in 1833 as agent for the Greenwich Estates in the north. On 8 Jan 1852 Josephine married George Butler at Corbridge, Northumberland. He had been a tutor at Durham University, and then a Public Examiner at Oxford University. In 1857 they moved to Cheltenham following husband's appointment as Vice-Principal of Cheltenham College. In 1866 they moved to Liverpool following husband's appointment as Head of Liverpool College. Josephine took up plight of girls in the Brownlow Hill workhouse and established a Home of Rest for girls in need. In 1868 Josephine became President of North England Council for Promoting Higher Education of Women, and in the following year she was Secretary of Ladies' National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts (extended by legislation in 1866 and 1869). In 1875 she established the International Abolitionist Federation in Liverpool. In 1883 the Contagious Diseases Acts were suspended. In 1885 the age of consent was raised to 16 which Josephine fought for. The Contagious Diseases Acts were repealed in 1886. From 1888 until Oct 1896, Josephine edited 'Dawn' a quarterly journal. In 1890 George Butler died. Josephine moved to London and continued campaigning against state regulation abroad. In 1894 she moved to her son's home in Galewood within Ewart Park near Milfield. In 1906 Josephine moved to Wooler where she died on 30 Dec and was buried at Kirknewton.\nArrangement: The archive has been arranged into 14 sub-fonds: A - Administration B - Enquiries and campaigns C - International work: India D - International work: other countries E - Papers relating to the International Abolitionist Federation F - Other organisations G - Photographs H - Memorials and centenaries I - Publicity J - Josephine Butler miscellanea K - Objects L - Paintings and drawings M - Publications N - Press cuttings Almost 800 pamphlets were transferred to The Printed Collections, as part of the Josephine Butler Society Library.

The charity began as the Invalid Children's Aid Association (ICAA) on 26 November 1888, founded by Allen Dowdeswell Graham, a clergyman, to help poor children who were either seriously ill or handicapped. In 1888, he wrote 'Poverty is bad enough, God knows, but the poor handicapped exist in a living hell. It's up to us to do something about it'. Allen Graham organised a group of home visit volunteers who took food, bedding and medicine to children and their families, and helped arrange admissions into hospitals and convalescent homes, holidays, apprenticeships, and the loan of spinal carriages, wheel chairs and perambulators. Royal patronage began in 1891 and continued throughout the 20th century. As the Association grew, volunteers were gradually replaced by professional social workers and 'Homes of Recovery' were set up, where the treatment of children with tuberculosis and rheumatic heart disease was first pioneered. The first of these residential establishments was Holt Sanatorium opened in 1906 and Parkstone Home for boys was opened in 1909. In 1935, the ICAA helped publicise the need for immunisation against diptheria by holding a conference in London. The ICAA worked closely with the London County Council in providing Care Committee Secretaries to the Schools for Physically Handicapped Children, and acting as an agent for the tuberculosis 'TB Contact Scheme' from 1925. During 1939 to 1945, the Association was involved in the special arrangements for the evacuation of physically handicapped children to homes or selected foster homes. The National Health Service Act 1948 introduced financial support for medical care and appliances required by the Association's social workers, enabling greater concentration on providing casework support to help alleviate the stress experienced by families with handicapped children. The Act also led to the transferral of the Association's Heart Hospital, which had been opened in 1926 to the Health Authorities and the gradual replacement of convalescence by short term holidays. In the 1950s the Association's motto was 'To every child a chance' and aims were: '1. To collect and put at the disposal of parents and others, all information with regard to the care of invalid and crippled children, and the facilities which exist for their treatment. 2. To co-operate with doctors, hospital almoners and others by reporting on those aspects of the child's social background which are relevant to the understanding and treatment of the illness. 3. To assist parents to carry out the doctor's advice with regard to treatment by :- a) Arranging convalescence where necessary. b) Helping them to understand, and where possible rectify, any adverse social conditions that may exist. 4. To help in the re-establishment of the child in normal life. 5. To visit the seriously invalided child.' With improvements in health care, the Association also began to concentrate on the educational problems arising from specific disabilities or chronic illness. In 1961 the Association organised an International Conference of Dyslexia and in 1964 the Word Blind Centre, Coram's Fields, was opened to study dyslexia and other reading difficulties. This led to the formation of the British Dyslexia Association. By 1981 the ICAA was maintaining five residential schools for children with special educational needs. It also ran a central information service, which provided free advice, and hired publications and films, and centres run by social workers in London and Surrey offering support to families with handicapped children. Social work services were run partly through grant aid from local authorities, and included Keith Grove Centre, Hammersmith which was opened in 1967, and Grenfell House Social Work Centre in 1981. In 1983 a Curriculum Development centre was opened for the research of teaching materials for children with speech and language disorders. The ICAA also expanded its area of work to include the Midlands and the North East with the opening of Carshalton Family Advice and Support Centre and regional offices. In 1986 the ICAA was renamed as I CAN. In the late 1990s I CAN delivered a range of direct and partnership services to help children by pioneering work in special schools, nurseries and centres within local schools and by providing training and information for parents, teachers and therapists. In 1999 there were 25,000 children with severe and complex speech and language impairment, with only 14 specialised schools available in the country, I CAN managing three of these at Dawn House School, John Horniman School and Meath School. In these schools I CAN employed teachers, speech and language therapists, educational psychologists, care staff and social workers. In the financial year April 2000 to March 2001 the charity's gross income was \u00a36,151,000, and expenditure was \u00a37,035,000. I CAN has been involved in national projects such as 'Changing lives', an initiative launched in 1999, aimed at changing 'early years' provision to support 1,200 children in 2002. Schools managed by ICAA and I CAN: Meath School, Surrey, established 1945, for junior boys with severe asthma and other respiratory disorders, later from 1982 for pupils with speech, language and communication difficulties. Pilgrims School, East Sussex, established in 1955, for senior boys with severe asthma and eczemia (the only specialised school for these conditions in England and Wales). John Horniman School, West Sussex, established in 1958, for children with severe communication disorders including hearing impairment. Dawn House School, Nottinghamshire, established in 1974, for children with hearing impairment. Edith Edwards House School, Surrey, established in 1956, for children with severe communication disorders and behavioural difficulties.

The documents in the Personal section relate to his family and himself generally, juvenilia, education, diaries, personal papers and photographs In the Professional section will be found papers and correspondence relating to his career and, in particular, to parochial matters at each benefice. The war years spent at St Matthew's are reflected in the wartime letters he sent to the members of his congregation who were serving in the armed forces. Their replies will be found in the general correspondence at the end of the list as Hussey himself did not keep these letter as a separate entity. The Cathedral years were spent working on many aspects of the renovation and repair of the building as well as the organising of special events such as the Royal visit, the Southern Choirs Festival and a Deans' and Provosts' Conference with special emphasis on art and the Church Also in the Professional section is a list of the files, on a variety of subjects, compiled by Hussey as a personal source of reference. Kept in alphabetical order these files contain extracts from books and articles, together with leaflets, pamphlets and newspaper cuttings The Speech section lists his broadcasts and contains scripts, correspondence and other material. Several boxes of sermons were found. The sermons were no longer in any specific order although some were divided up according to the church calender. On the back of each sermon Hussey carefully noted the places, dates and times on which the sermon had been preached. The sermons have now been arranged chronologically according to the first date on which they were delivered. Among the documents has been placed a list of sermons arranged in chronological order of delivery throughout his life (document number 220) and a list of sermons, addresses, speeches and talks arranged in alphabetical order (document number 221). There is also a list of addresses, speeches and talks arranged in chronological order (document number 274) The fourth section, Writings, contains all the material found in connection with his printed works. Hussey wrote a few articles, edited one book, Chichester 900, and wrote another about his connection with the arts, appropriately entitled Patron of Art Walter Hussey and the Arts contains all the papers and correspondence which he kept about the many works which he commissioned at St Matthew's and at Chichester Cathedral. He kept all correspondence with each artist in its own set of files. In compiling this list his example has been followed while at the same time adding any other documents or photographs found elsewhere in the collection. This section also deals with his own art collection and his correspondence in connection with Pallant House Gallery Finally the Correspondence section of this list contains all letters which are of a general nature and do not fit into any other group of documents Bibliography Neil Colyer : The Walter Hussey Collection, Pallant House Gallery [1982] Walter Hussey : Patron of Art, Weidenfeld and Nicolson 1985 FOREWORD In his entry in Who's Who, Walter Hussey gave his sole recreation as 'enjoying the arts'. This enjoyment, not just of the arts, but of all aspects of his life, shines through the archive of his papers and through the enduring legacy of his life and work, in Chichester Cathedral and at Pallant House, the Chichester gallery that opened in 1982 to inherit and show his personal collection In the Cathedral, we have the fruits of Hussey's public life and career. At Pallant House we can see his own personal taste and the remarkable foresight and sensitivity he brought to collecting art. The archive at the West Sussex Record Office completes the picture with his own personal papers, which give endlessly fascinating insights into this very private man In his lifetime and in his autobiography, Hussey's remarkable and outstanding contribution to modern art in Britain was very much played down. Now, thanks to the archive and to this catalogue, we can start to appreciate more fully what this contribution was and to give Dean Hussey the credit that is due to him for the part he played in the revival of Church patronage of contemporary artists David Coke March 1997 HUSSEY FAMILY HISTORY PERSONAL CHRISTOPHER ROWDEN HUSSEY JOHN ROWDEN HUSSEY LILIAN MARY HUSSEY [n\u00e9e Atherton] JOHN WALTER ATHERTON HUSSEY Education Membership of clubs and societies Health Finance Diaries Appointment diaries Notebooks Address books, lists, quotations and sketches Autographs Photographs Silhouettes Personal miscellaneous papers Newspaper cuttings Personalia PROFESSIONAL CAREER Ordination papers and papers of appointment Correspondence regarding ecclesiastical appointments Appointments offered to Walter Hussey, but not accepted Appointments to institutions and other bodies Honours and presentations Retirement Posthumous S MARY ABBOT'S S PAUL'S KENSINGTON S MATTHEW'S, NORTHAMPTON Papers relating to parochial matters WH's wartime letters to the Forces Sermons by laymen Preachers S Matthew's Day S Matthew's Jubilee Festival 1943 S Matthew's Diamond Jubilee 1953 Printed matter Books and guides Miscellaneous CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL Ceremony and Procedure Fabric and Fittings Services and Correspondence Commemoration of Benefactors Precedence General Chapter Deans' Conferences Deans' and Provosts' Conferences Deans' and Provosts' Conference, Chichester 10-13 May 1968 Arundel Screen/Bell Memorial Bell Rooms Choir, Organist, Organ and Song School Embroidery Projects Royal Air Force Royal Visit S Mary Magdalen Chapel Schoolboys' Conference Sherburne Monument Sherburne Screen Southern Choirs Festival Surveyor - Robert Potter Chichester Cathedral Survey 1962 Chichester Cathedral Restoration Fund The Sussex Campaign Theological College Wall paintings in the Lady Chapel Westgate Fields West Porch Printed matter FILES SPEECH BROADCASTS (radio and television) SERMONS ADDRESSES, SPEECHES AND TALKS TOASTS AND MENU CARDS WRITINGS PUBLISHED ARTICLES CHICHESTER 900 PATRON OF ART WALTER HUSSEY AND THE ARTS S MATTHEW'S COMMISSIONS Malcolm Arnold Wystan Hugh Auden Edward Barnsley BBC BBC Symphony Orchestra Lennox Berkeley Sir John Betjeman The Boyd Neel Orchestra Benjamin Britten James Butt Sir (John) Ninian Comper Harold Craxton Cecil Day Lewis Walter de la Mare Ralph William Downes Ronald Duncan M Durufl\u00e9 Edward Elgar Thomas Stearns Eliot Hans Feibusch Gerald Finzi Kirsten Flagstad Christopher Fry George Kruger Gray Christopher Headington Colin Horsley James Iliff Frank Martin Henry Moore Norman Nicholson Gordon Pemble John Piper [see under Chichester Cathedral Commissions] Edmund Rubbra Alexander Smith Igor Stravinsky Graham Sutherland Denis Tegetmeier Michael Tippett William Walton Ralph Vaughan Williams Harold S Williamson Hugh Ross Williamson CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL COMMISSIONS William Albright Lennox Berkeley Leonard Bernstein Benjamin Britten [see under S Matthew's Commissions] Marc Chagall Geoffrey Clarke Cecil Collins Henry Moore [see under S Matthew's Commissions] John Piper Ceri Giraldus Richards Reynolds Stone Graham Sutherland [See under S Matthew's Commissions] William Walton WALTER HUSSEY'S ART COLLECTION Correspondence and other material Pallant House Musical scores Presentation books and typescripts Printed material CORRESPONDENCE Correspondence Correspondence - unidentified surnames Christmas cards\nAdministrative history: John Walter Atherton Hussey, churchman and art lover, was well known in his lifetime for his championing of contemporary art and, in particular, for bringing together the Church and modern artists. He will long be remembered for the works he commissioned for St Matthew's, Northampton and for Chichester Cathedral. Much of his own private collection may now be seen at Pallant House Gallery in Chichester Walter Hussey, as he was known, was born on 15 May 1909, the younger son of Canon John Rowden Hussey and his wife Lilian. John Hussey was then vicar of St Matthew's, Northampton, a living which he had held since the church was built in 1893. As a small boy Walter attended The Knoll, a preparatory school at Woburn Sands, from where he won a foundation scholarship to Marlborough College in 1922. In 1927 he went up to Keble College, Oxford to read PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics), obtaining his BA in 1930. Before entering Cuddesdon Theological College in July 1931 he spent some time as a schoolmaster at Charleston, a preparatory school in Seaford, Sussex In 1932 Hussey was ordained by the bishop of London to the title of St Mary Abbot's, Kensington, where he remained as curate until 1937. During that time he was in charge of the daughter church of St Paul's, Kensington, from 1935-6, returning to St Mary Abbot's for a few months as senior curate. In 1937 he succeeded his father as vicar of St Matthew's. In his book, Patron of Art, Hussey wrote 'Perhaps my succeeding him may suggest nepotism, but I don't think it was. I was not anxious to go there; it seemed that there was little one could do but let the parish down.my various authorities advised me that it was right that I should go.' During his school and university years Hussey had shown an interest in the arts, music, drama, painting and sculpture. His years in London gave him the opportunity of seeing and hearing much that the city had to offer in its concert halls, theatres and art galleries, and he began to take an increasing interest in contemporary art. It became a cause of regret to him to realise how little of this work was being encouraged by the Church. As he later wrote, 'the arts had become largely divorced from the Church' By the time Hussey became vicar of St Matthew's he was already making plans to bring about a rapprochement between the Church and the arts. An early opportunity presented itself as he starting planning the forthcoming golden jubilee celebrations due to take place at St Matthew's in 1943. He had already had the experience of making arrangements for such a jubilee at St Paul's, Kensington, but now he wanted to incorporate a modern musical work into the festival service. In spite of the difficulties and restrictions of the war years the jubilee celebrations were a triumph as they centred around the specially commissioned anthem Rejoice in the Lamb by Benjamin Britten. Encouraged by this success Hussey went on to commission many more works for his Northampton church, the most famous of which were Henry Moore's sculpture, Madonna and Child, and Graham Sutherland's painting, The Crucifixion When Hussey went to Chichester as dean in 1955 he had known Bishop Bell for many years and knew that they shared the same attitude to art and the Church. Consequently the work he had begun in St Matthew's continued almost uninterrupted in the cathedral with works by Graham Sutherland, John Piper, Leonard Bernstein and Marc Chagall among the many which he commissioned over the years By the time Hussey retired from Chichester in 1977 to live in London he had acquired an important and varied collection of his own. He offered to leave the greater part of it to the city which he had done so much to promote as a centre of the arts. Like many others he was concerned about the neglect into which Pallant House, a fine example of eighteenth-century domestic architecture, had fallen and, as Dr KME Murray wrote 'his generous offer.was made deliberately as a means of securing the restoration of the house and its opening to the public'. In 1982 Hussey was present at the official opening of the house and saw his paintings and other works of art displayed in the same informal domestic setting as they had been at the deanery where he had taken so much pleasure in showing them to friends and strangers alike Walter Hussey died in London on 25 July 1985. His funeral service was conducted at St Paul's, Knightsbridge, and a memorial service was held in Chichester Cathedral in October of that year",

Correspondence, 1927-1974, comprises two main sequences, one arranged alphabetically, the other chronologically; 'day files', principally carbons of outgoing correspondence, 1966-1969; a sequence of references and recommendations; also including correspondence relating to Lonsdale's period of imprisonment (1943). Correspondents include scientists such as Max Born, W H Bragg, W L Bragg, E G Cox, Dorothy Hodgkin, Judith Milledge, L C Pauling and A J C Wilson.\nAdministrative history: Dame Kathleen Lonsdale was one of the foremost X-ray crystallographers of the 20th century and one of the first two women to be elected (in 1945, with Marjory Stephenson) Fellow of the Royal Society. Born Kathleen Yardley in Newbridge, Southern Ireland, in 1903, she was the youngest of ten children in a family at times reduced to poverty. In 1908 the family moved to Seven Kings in Essex and Lonsdale attended the County High School for Girls in Ilford where she consistently achieved academic excellence. At the age of sixteen she won a place at Bedford College for Women and graduated in physics in 1922. Her achievement in finishing first in the University of London BSc Honours exam immediately gained her a place in W.H. Bragg's research team, first at University College London and, from 1923, at the Royal Institution. Lonsdale, working with W.T. Astbury, began to apply space group theories, developed by Harold Hilton and others at the beginning of the century, to the study of X-ray diffraction patterns from crystals. Their important paper 'Tabulated data for the examination of the 230 space-groups by homogeneous X-rays' was submitted to the Royal Society and published in Philosophical Transactions (1924). In the following years international crystallographers recognised the need for more comprehensive tables for crystal structure determination. Lonsdale was a member of the editorial group concerned with the production of new tables and, working from home in the early 1930s following the birth of her first child, provided the structure factor formulae for each space group. The resulting International Tables, published in 1935, proved to be only the beginning of a project to which she devoted a great amount of time and effort during the rest of her career. In 1948 Lonsdale was made the first Chairman of the new Commission on Tables and was the principal editor in the production of the new volumes of International Tables, the first of which appeared in 1951. Following her marriage in 1927 Lonsdale worked briefly at the University of Leeds where she carried out important analyses of hexamethylbenzene and hexachlorobenzene crystals. She returned to the Royal Institution in 1931 and remained there for fifteen years, concentrating on research on diamagnetic anisotropy. Her work on the magnetic anisotropy of benzil led to her studies of disorder in crystals caused by thermal motions, one of her principal research interests during the rest of her career. In 1946 Lonsdale accepted the post of Reader in Crystallography at University College London, becoming Professor of Chemistry in 1949. She established her own research school there and introduced two new courses in crystallography, one for undergraduates and the other for graduates. Among a wide diversity of interests, she studied methonium compounds, urinary calculi and synthetic diamonds, though her work on the International Tables diverted a considerable amount of her time away from research. Lonsdale and her husband became Quakers in 1935 and her pacifism led to her refusal to register for civil defence duties, although she was willing to work as a volunteer. On her refusal to pay a fine imposed for non-registration she was imprisoned in Holloway gaol for one month in 1943. Prison was a formative experience for her, and the insights that she gained while at Holloway prompted her to take an active interest in penal reform. She was made a member of the Board of Visitors, Aylesbury Prison for Women and Borstal Institution for Girls in 1949 and later served as Deputy Chairman of the Board of Visitors of a borstal in Essex. World peace and ethics in science were issues which also concerned her. She was Vice- President of the Atomic Scientists' Association and President of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. She attended several Pugwash Conferences on World Affairs and expressed her hopes for peace in numerous articles, including a Penguin Special 'Is Peace Possible?, and lectures. Lonsdale's scientific career and peace interests required her to undertake a considerable amount of foreign travel. Among the scientific conferences in which she participated were Congresses of the International Union of Crystallography from 1948. On some trips she combined scientific engagements and lectures with those relating to peace and religious issues. She undertook some foreign engagements on behalf of the Society of Friends. Lonsdale was a member of Council and Vice-President of the Royal Society, 1960-1961; Vice President of the International Union of Crystallography, 1960-1966, and President in 1966; General Secretary of the British Association, 1959-1964, and President of the Physics Section in 1967; and President of the British Association in 1968, the first woman to hold the post. In the years following her election to the Royal Society, Lonsdale received many other awards in recognition of her contributions to science. She was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1956 and awarded the Davy Medal of the Royal Society in 1957. She received honorary degrees (DSc or LLD) from several universities including those of Wales, Leicester, Manchester, Oxford, Bath and Leeds. In 1927 she married Thomas Jackson Lonsdale. They had three children. Lonsdale died on 1 April 1971.",

        "Description": "'I started before 10 this morning for an invitation walk at the Forum with Baddeley. There were about 15 of his friends, amongst them the Trenchs. I walkedhome with him and he asked me to call, so that little difficulty is dealt with. I don't like them well enough to go without being asked as I think they are [the] sort of people who would think you wanted them to entertain you. Then a bright dark elderly little Miss Broadwood said at once she had met me at the Trench's at Cadenabbia when Joan was with me. I fancy she is a relation of Mrs. Shearme's. I did not know the others and was not introduced but they seemed pleasant. Lord and Lady Manners and I think Lord De Freyne who seemed sociable. I got back just in time for lunch and afterwards fell asleep until nearly 4 when I thought I would go into the next street and see how Janet was getting on and show her yours and Joan's photographs, but I found she had gone out and might not be back before 6. so I infer she is quite well again. I came home as it was gloomy and beginning to rain and now I want to post this before 6 p.m. Wednesday and see if it reaches you by Friday. I had your letter this morning written on Sunday so evidently letters leaving London early in the morning get here quicker, probably come through by the train I left Victoria by - which is due at Rome 7.30 the morning of the next day but one. I think your answer about the chapel will do (Seaview) - I don't see why I should be asked again as I gave them \u00a310, and my being abroad is a good excuse. I should be glad if you would send \u00a31. 1. 0. cheque to The Secretary, London Fever Hospital, Liverpool Road, N. and just a slip of paper saying I regret my sub was not paid on 14th inst. through my absence abroad. Joanie writes me a nice letter today - she says their car is to be royal blue which I should think would be very good colour for a motor and with light blue line. I prefer for us sticking to our yellow. I am rather glad they have decided against the Maas for I did not like the appearance of the depot nor the manners of the Agent - a regular Yankee he seemed, who would plume himself if he could do you in the eye. I will enclose a note for you to forward re pageant. It would be something to ask people to come to see and the motor would hold 5, so I am saying I would take 5 special enclosure tickets. It is tomorrow I lunch with Miss Blount - I liked the look of her hotel better than this but I shall not migrate as I really am very comfortable and like my Luige who valets me. The drawback is that there are very few English and I think it has only just been put on the footing of the 1st class hotels. It was a large pension under former owner. The hotels are not nearly so full now and I think it must have been the ghost of carnival that made them so full when I arrived on Shrove Tuesday. I have not really felt lonely yet - though Rome to me suggests the good times I used to have here and the high hopes of 35 years ago. I wish I could feel my life had been of the use I hoped it might have been - I really think if I did not feel I had drawn the greatest of all prizes in our happy marriage - I should say 'cui bono' but I do trust I have made you a happier little woman than you would have been alone and I think we tried to do our duty to our child - but in all public things I feel a failure - though due as much to change of times as to my own faults. Now not to be gloomy, here is a story of the effect of the late unusual snow in Rome and the difference in subjects English and foreigners think should not be mentioned. A certain Mrs. Hall, slightly deaf, had been indisposed and when she appeared again in the Table d'hote room, an Italian gentleman leaned across from the next little table and enquired kindly 'Come sta lo stomaco stassera Signora?'. She did not hear well so he tried English, 'How is your stow mack?' She answered 'Quite white and freezing still', thinking he was talking of snow on the ground. And now dearest, goodnight. I do love your letters so. It is quite warm though wet this evening.' (107/35)",

        "Title": "Copies of documents relating to the Taylor family of Brighton and Robertsbridge in Salehurst",
        "Description": "These papers relate to three generations of the Taylor family of Brighton and their property in Western Road, Stone Street and Clarence Square. Elias Taylor (1808-1871) was baptised at Fawley in Hampshire on 10 July 1808, the son of Elias Taylor and Elizabeth Wyatt. On 26 March 1832 at Brighton he married Mary Daws, daughter of William Daws, and following her death he married, again at Brighton, Mary Burgess, the daughter of Thomas and Mary Burgess of Ewhurst, on 13 February 1837. In 1841 and 1851 Elias Taylor was enumerated in Western Road, Brighton, as a stationer. By 1861, when he was listed as a proprietor of houses, he had moved to Hartford Villa in Patcham, where he died on 29 December 1871. His will, leaving an estate of under \u00a34000, was proved by William Dawson Savage of Ellerslie House, Park Road, Brighton, chemist, and Thomas Williams of Wadhurst, farmer, on 14 February 1872. In 1867, when drafts were prepared for the sale of 10 and 11 Montpelier Street, Elias Taylor was decribed as out of business, and since by 1894 number 11 was owned by his daughter Kate Taylor, perhaps the conveyance was executed to keep the property out of the hands of his creditors. It is possible that Elias Taylor's financial embarrassment was brought about by the failure in business of his son Harry Taylor. Harry Taylor, Elias and Mary's first child, was born in Brighton in about 1838. In 1861 he and his wife Eleanor were enumerated at 63 Western Road, an account-book manufacturer employing one boy. The 1863 directory is more expansive, listing Harry as a bookseller, stationer, book-binder, machine ruler and account-book maker. Harry Taylor then disappears from view and, unless he is to be identified as the Robert H Taylor, a fancy bazaar keeper living with his wife Ellen and son Robert H Taylor at Thornton Heath in 1871, the next trace is his death at Hartford Villa in Patcham, a photographer with an estate of under \u00a3600, on 5 April 1877. His will was proved by Henry Abbey of Fairlee, Brighton, brewer, on 16 May 1877. Harry's son Robert Harry Norman Taylor, known as Harry, was aged about ten at his father's death, and seems to have been assisted by his father's sister Kate Taylor, who remained unmarried. At the end of the 1880s he went to work for his cousin Robert Henry Burgess at Park Farm, Robertsbridge, but by 1889 had acquired the tenancy of a farm of his own. On 21 May 1889 he married Emily, daughter of Charles Davis, a widower of Goodgrooms Farm in Salehurst, and the couple lived there until after March 1892; a stillborn daughter was delivered in May 1890. In an extensive series of letters to his aunt, Harry confessed to having sown 'some very wild oats when I first went to the Park', but declared an intention to settle down to farming. The capital was provided by Kate Taylor, who also seems to have managed her late father's property in Brighton, to some of the rental from which Harry was entitled. Kate's sister Fanny Taylor, Harry's aunt, had married Henry Abbey at Patcham on 23 June 1859 (PAR 437/1/3/2). Abbey, who died in 1911 at the age of 94 at Fairlee Villa, Abbey Street (formerly Great College Street), seems to have become the patriarch of his wife's generation of Taylors. At first Harry was not on the best of terms with his Abbey cousins, and seems to have resented the tendency of his other aunts to entrust their business to Henry Abbey, a prominent brewer and an alderman of Brighton. In 1890 he expressed himself 'rather put out with the whole Fairlee party' after receiving a critical letter from Aunt Fanny. Despite his aunt Kate's help Harry gave up farming and moved to London. In 1898 he wrote from a new address in Fulham to request a further loan of \u00a31000 'to give me another start in life'; he was enumerated there in 1901 as a commercial traveller. By 1905 he made clear to Kate Taylor that his aunt Fanny had been good to him; the letter, from West Ealing, ends on a slightly acrimonious note. Harry's final letter from Goodgrooms, written on 8 January 1910, thanks his aunt for paying a doctor's account, and expresses hope that with good weather, he will manage to get on 'now aunt Fanny has helped me to get this little business'. Harry and his wife sent flowers to the funeral of his uncle Henry Abbey, JP, who died on 11 September 1911 (Sussex Daily News, 14 September 1911 page 8 column d), and was remembered with a legacy of \u00a350 in the will of his widow Fanny the following year (ACC 5376/48/4).",

        "Title": "William Adlington Cadbury (1867-1957)",
        "Description": "William Adlington Cadbury (1867-1957) was the fourth child of Richard Cadbury and Elizabeth (Adlington) Cadbury; he was born at 17 Wheeleys Road Edgbaston. He went to live with his grandfather John Cadbury and Aunt Maria at Calthorpe Road following the death of his mother when he was less than two years old. Following the marriage of his father to Emma Wilson, his grandfather built two houses at 73 Harborne Road and the family was reunited. In 1883 the family moved from Harborne Road to Moseley Hall. When William was 11 years old he was sent to dig holes on land his father and uncle had recently purchased near Stirchley; as these holes were never filled he is credited with breaking the first ground for the beginning of Bournville. He attended a Friends (Quaker) Boarding School near Southport, later moving to ''Woodlands' at Hitchin. At aged 18, in 1884 he went to work in the engineering shop of J. J. Seekings of Gloucester. In 1886 he gained experience in the machine shop and drawing office of Stollwerck, the well known German chocolate firm in Cologne. He entered the family business in 1887 at the now established Bournville site. After the death of his father, Richard Cadbury, in 1899, George Cadbury (William's paternal uncle) formed Cadbury Bros. into a limited company making William, his brother Barrow and his own two sons, Edward and George, directors. After the death of George Cadbury, William was appointed Chairman of Cadbury Bros., 1922-1937. William was only 55 when he began to be affected by lameness and in 1955 his leg was amputated. Emmeline Hannah (nee Wilson) Cadbury (1883-1966): William met Emmeline Wilson (the niece of his stepmother) in 1889 and they were married in September 1902 when she was 18. Emmeline became a magistrate in 1934. She was involved in the Girl Guide movement for 30 years. She was also the President of the Birmingham Branch of the National Council of Women, Vice President of the Royal College of Nursing and an Officer of the Order of St John of Jerusalem. After the couple married they lived at 12, Sir Harrys Road, Edgbaston. They had 6 children: Hannah (Joy) b. 1903, John b. 1905, Alan b. 1907, Constance b.1910, Richard Tapper b. 1911, and Brandon b. 1915. The family's house Wast Hills was built in 1905 and used as a summer home until 1910 when the purchase of a car made it practical as a permanent residence. William travelled extensively during his life; he enjoyed travelling by sea and was particularly fond of the West Coast of Ireland. In 1901, whilst in the Caribbean, William heard a rumour that slave labour was employed to produce the cocoa used by Cadbury Bros. in Sao Thome and Principe (West Africa). This information led to William carrying out research and starting political enquiries into the issue of contract labour. In 1908 William travelled to the area to make investigations, in the same year the Standard newspaper accused the Cadburys of indifference and hypocrisy regarding the use of slave labour; the Cadburys pursued and won a case for libel although they were awarded only a farthing in damages (less than the cost of a newspaper). From 1907 William developed new sources of cocoa in Ghana and from 1909 on Cadbury Bros. boycotted the purchase of cocoa from Sao Thome and Principe. William sat on the City Council from 1911-1939, he was made an Alderman in 1919 and held the office of Lord Mayor of Birmingham from 1919-1921. He notably refused an instruction from the Prime Minister to form a Civil Defence Unit to quell public unrest caused by the depression. The Cadbury family were benefactors of numerous artists, civil and charitable projects in the city. After the First World War William became greatly concerned to help the recovery of war-torn Europe and was involved in and supported many projects on the continent. William and Emmeline founded the Trident Trust in 1911 and later the W. A. Cadbury Trust in 1923 to further their charitable activities (see MS 1579/1). Throughout his life William regularly attended Bull Street Meeting of The Society of Friends (Quakers); he rarely spoke but held the position of an Elder and Secretary. The couple had a particular interest in the work of the Friends (Emmeline's parents were renowned Quaker Missionaries) and contributed to projects generously. During his later confined years William took on the role of Cadbury family historian and archivist and he also prepared a record of Friends connected with the Bull Street Meeting in the 19th century. William Wilson (1857-1909) and Hannah Wilson (1958-1945) were Emmeline Cadbury's parents. They studied to become teachers at Wigton School, Cumberland, where they met, and William later trained to be a doctor. He joined the Friends Foreign Mission Association (FFMA) in 1877. He was first based in Madagascar, where later Hannah joined him following their marriage. He returned to England in 1900, took the post of the Secretary of FFMA and along with travelling extensively in Madagascar he joined deputations to Syria, China and India. He died suddenly following an operation to remove his appendix in 1909. The material in the most part relates to William's family and personal interests. It comprises a large number of letters and photographs, and a smaller number of diaries, household records and publications.",

Books within the collection include Sir Edward Elgar's own copies of printed literary works by George Bernard Shaw and a copy of 'Chantecler' by Edmond Rostand given by Sir Edward Elgar to his wife, Lady Caroline Alice Elgar.\nAdministrative history: Edward William Elgar was born on 2 June 1857, son of William Henry Elgar and Ann (Greening) Elgar. His father, William Henry Elgar, served as organist at St. George's Church, Worcester and was a local piano tuner and teacher. As a child, Edward Elgar studied piano, organ and violin. His earliest surviving musical work titled 'Humoreske, a tune from Broadheath' was composed in 1867. Elgar continued to compose whilst working in a solicitor's office in 1872 and, from 1873, he studied scores to develop his musical knowledge whilst working in his father's piano shop. He was to remain largely unknown as a composer until the 1890s, composing locally in Worcester for the Choir of St. George's Church and the Crown Hotel Glee Club. He began to give violin lessons and, in January 1879, he was appointed as musical director for the 'County Lunatic Asylum' in Powick, a post he held for almost five years. Elgar's first published work came in 1878, a 'Romance in E Minor' for violin and piano, published by Schott. In 1885, Edward Elgar succeeded his father as organist for St. George's Church. In 1882 he became engaged to Helen Weaver, but by the summer of 1884, Helen had broken off the engagement. Edward Elgar became engaged again in September 1888 to Caroline Alice Roberts, daughter of the late Major General Sir Henry Roberts. They were married on 8 May 1889 at The Oratory in Brompton, London. Alice was 9 years older than Edward and was a poet and novelist. Many of her poems were later used by Edward as words for songs. Just prior to their marriage, in August 1888, Elgar wrote 'Liebesgruss' [Love's Greeting] which he dedicated to his wife. This was to become one of his most famous compositions, later published by Schott as 'Salut d'Amour'. After their marriage, Alice and Edward rented houses in London, where they were able to attend concerts and operas. In May 1890 he began composing his overture 'Froissart', with the first public performance held in Worcester on 10 September 1890. On 14 August 1890, their daughter, Carice Irene Elgar, was born and in June 1891, the family returned to Worcestershire, moving to 'Forli', Alexandra Road, Malvern. Edward Elgar returned to music teaching, as composition was not yet yielding a suitable income. During the summer of 1892, Alice and Edward Elgar accompanied a friend, Minnie Baker, to the Bayreuth Festival in Germany. This was followed by trips to Bavaria in 1893, 1894, 1895 and 1897 and these visits had considerable influence of Edward Elgar's composition. In 1895, he produced songs 'From the Bavarian Highlands'. In 1897, orchestral versions of three of these songs were published as 'Three Bavarian Dances'. Major compositions between 1892 and 1897 included 'The Black Knight' (1892), an 'Organ Sonata in G' (1895), 'Scenes from the Sagas of King Olaf' (1896), 'The Light of Life' [Lux Christi] composed for the 1896 Worcester Three Choirs Festival and an 'Imperial March' dedicated to Queen Victoria (1897). In 1898, Elgar began sketching 'Variations on an Original Theme (Enigma)' which he dedicated 'To my friends pictured within'. The 14 variations are intended to reflect aspects of the character of his friends, along with his wife and himself. For the Birmingham Festival in 1900, Elgar composed a choral work 'The Dream of Gerontius' based on a poem by Cardinal Newman. In 1901 he completed an overture 'Cockaigne' and the first two 'Pomp and Circumstance' marches, including March No.1 in D. Major ('Land of Hope and Glory'). Elgar's popularity continued to grow and 'The Dream of Gerontius' was performed in Dusseldorf in 1901 and 1902. It was performed again at the Worcester Festival in September 1902. It was during October 1902 in Sheffield, that Elgar's friend Frank Schuster introduced him to local MP Charles Stuart Wortley. His wife, Alice Stuart Wortley, who Elgar named 'windflower', was to become a source of inspiration for many of his subsequent works. For the 1903 Birmingham Festival, Elgar composed a new choral work 'The Apostles'. The Elgars spent Christmas 1903 and January 1904 in Alassio, Italy, which inspired an overture titled 'In the South (Alassio)'. Edward Elgar was by now one of the most popular English composers and on 24 June 1904 he received a Knighthood. The Universities of Durham and Leeds also offered him honorary doctorates of music. On 26 November 1904, Elgar accepted an offer of the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. His inaugural lecture was given on 16 March 1905. His lectures created controversy in the winter of 1905-1906 and he resigned the post in August 1908. During 1905-1906, key compositions included an 'Introduction and Allegro for Strings', a further part of the Apostles titled 'The Kingdom' and 'In Smyrna', for piano, inspired by a Mediterranean cruise taken with the British fleet at the invitation of Lord Charles Beresford. Elgar received international fame and recognition. In June 1905, Elgar was awarded an honorary doctorate from Yale University. During 1907, he received an honorary degree at Pittsburgh and he travelled in America during 1906 and 1907 conducting concerts in Cincinatti, Chicago and New York. Elgar's 1st Symphony in A flat premiered on 3 December 1908 in Manchester. His Violin Concerto premiered on 10 November 1910 with Fritz Kreisler as soloist. Elgar completed his 2nd Symphony in E Flat in February 1911. He orchestrated a Coronation March for King George V in 1911 and was appointed to the Order of Merit. In March 1911, Elgar was also appointed as conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra. On New Year's Day of 1912, the family moved to Severn House in Hampstead, London. During 1912, Elgar composed an Imperial Masque 'The Crown of India', and also a choral work 'The Music Makers' for the Birmingham Festival in October 1912. In 1913, Elgar composed an orchestral work 'Falstaff' for the Leeds Festival and was also approached by The Gramophone Compnay (His Master's Voice) who asked Elgar to produce two short pieces for gramophone recordings. During the First World War, Elgar produced three pieces for chorus and orchestra based on poems by Laurence Binyon, 'For the fallen', 'To Women' and 'The fourth of August', collectively known as 'The Spirit of England'. In 1915 he composed a symphonic prelude 'Polonia' in aid of the Polish Victims Relief Fund. He was also approached by the actress Lena Ashwell to produce a score for a play 'The Starlight Express' and he produced music for a ballet 'The Sanguine Fan' in 1917. Also during 1917, Elgar orchestrated 'The Fringes of the Fleet' based on four poems by Rudyard Kipling. In May 1917, the family moved to a cottage 'Brinkwells' near Fittleworth, Sussex. Whilst at Brinkwells, Elgar began sketching his Cello Concerto and also a violin sonata and wind quintet. The Cello Concerto was premiered on 27 October 1919, although insufficient rehearsal time resulted in a poor performance. Lady Caroline Alice Elgar died on 6 April 1920 from lung cancer. She was buried in Little Malvern. In March 1921, Carice Elgar became engaged to Samuel Blake, a Surrey farmer and they were married on 16 January 1922. Elgar composed much less after the death of his wife. During 1922, he composed a score for 'Arthur', a play by Laurence Binyon. In April 1922, he moved to Napleton Grange near Kempsey. On 5 May 1923, Elgar was made Master of the King's Musik after the death of Sir Walter Parratt. Before Christmas 1927, Elgar moved to Battenhall Manor, outside Worcester, but from the spring of 1928 he rented Tiddington House near Stratford-upon-Avon. In 1929, Edward Elgar moved to Marl Bank, Rainbow Hill in Worcester, where he resided until his death. There, in 1930, he composed a brass band score 'The Severn Suite' and a 'Nursery Suite'. On 2 June 1931, Elgar received a baronetcy. He continued to produce recordings for The Gramophone Company (HMV) and, on 12 November 1931, opened the new HMV Studios in Abbey Road, St. John's Wood. During November 1931, Elgar met Vera Hockman, who was a violinist for the Croydon Philharmonic Orchestra and his relationship with Vera was to continue until his death in 1934. In 1931 and 1932, Elgar's friends, including George Bernard Shaw, requested that he compose a third symphony. This was commissioned by the BBC. However Elgar was unable to complete the symphony before his death. In October 1933, an operation for sciatic pain revealed previously undiagnosed cancer and he died on 23 February 1934. In May 1935, the City of Worcester purchased the cottage in Lower Broadheath, Worcestershire, where Edward Elgar was born. This opened as a museum in 1938, with his daughter Carice Elgar Blake as its first curator.

Hockerill was probably the tenth in order of foundation of the Women's Colleges, whose history goes back to the founding in 1811, of the 'National Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church throughout England and Wales'. The College was founded by the diocese of Rochester which included, at that time, Hertfordshire and Essex and was known as the Rochester Diocesan Institute for the Training of Schoolmistresses. The establishment of the College reflected the revolutionary change in the education system that began in the early part of the nineteenth century. At the beginning of the nineteenth century children were taught on a monitorial system, the teachers taught the monitors and the monitors the children. Masters were employed 'to organise, to reward, to punish and to inspire' - but not to teach. (2) In 1846 Dr Kay Shuttleworth was instrumental in inaugurating the pupil teacher system. This was a five year apprenticeship for youths from 13 - 18 years of age. Each day the pupil teacher did five and half hours teaching and each week he or she received seven hours instruction. At the end of their apprenticeship the pupil teachers could compete for Queen's scholarships which gave entry to a three year training college course. The College received pupil teachers who had received the Queen's scholarship free of charge for one year. At the end of the year the scholarship might be renewed for a second year. There were also a limited number of exhibitions for deserving cases who had failed to get a scholarship. The earliest extant record concerning the College is that of a meeting held in London on December 30th 1847 chaired by the Bishop of Rochester (D/EHk1/1). The members described themselves as a Provisional Committee. The project was initially expected to be financed by subscriptions and some donations had already been received. They appointed a Sites Sub Committee to inspect various sites according to the fourfold specification they laid down for the site. 1) It had to comprise between one and two acres; 2) it was to be near a railway station; 3) there had to be the possibility of obtaining sittings in the parish church for staff and students; and 4) the possibility of uniting a practising school to the Institute. The sub committee examined sites all over Hertfordshire and on March 23rd 1848 they decided on a site in Hertford which lay betwen All Saints' Church and the Cowper Testimonial School, and requested the Diocesan Architect, Joseph Clarke, to supply plans for a building the cost of which was not to exceed \u00a36000 exclusive of fittings. He produced two engravings of the College as he hoped it would be (D/EHk6/8/3). However, due to the difficulties of assigning a practising school to the Institute the plans at Hertford were abandoned. On August 16th, 1848 the sub committee inspected sites at Bishop's Stortford, where a new parish was to be formed needing both a church and schools. The vicar of St Michael's, Bishop's Stortford, the Reverend F W Rhodes showed great interest in the proposals. The schools were to be built on part of the training institute itself (see D/EHk3). On January 15th, 1850 the committee purchased the piece of land known as Bramblefields. Unfortunately, however, subscriptions had not been received at the expected 1. G A Wood, The History of Hockerill Training College p3 D/EHk5/1/5 2. Ibid p1 3. Eric Midwinter, Nineteenth Century Education (Longman 1973) p35 rate and the Committee had to apply for grants, the Privy Council gave \u00a33000 for the College and \u00a3200 for the practising schools and the National Society contributed \u00a3600 and \u00a350 respectively. In January 1852, All Saints Church, Hockerill was completed and opened and the vicar, the Reverend John Menet, was appointed to be Chaplain of the Institute. (4) The college buildings were finished in March of that year but the Committee refused to have the buildings opened until all the debts were paid, and until they had received promises of \u00a3600 a year for the first four years, since it was impossible that the College could be self-financing immediately. On November 10th, 1852 the Institute was formally opened. The ceremonies began with a service in All Saints Church, performed by the Bishop of Rochester, assisted by a large number of the clergy and laity. On November 11th, 1852 the Bishop of Rochester nominated a House Committee (D/EHk1/6-17) which would meet regularly and report to the Committee of Management (D/EHk1/2-4) that had been elected by the Education Boards of Essex and Hertfordshire. Between November 10th, 1852 and January, 1853 only a few students were admitted and no regular work was done. In January, 1853 nineteen students assembled, in September, twenty-eight, until in 1858 fifty seven students enrolled and the College was declared full. The students were all between sixteen and twenty five years of age and were carefully selected. As well as being recommended by their local clergyman, they had to sit a written examination conducted either by the College Chaplain or some duly appointed clergyman. If they were accepted then it was for a probationary period of six weeks. Once this period was over the student settled down for two years. The Institute did, however, run shorter courses. In 1856 not only was the Maintenance Fund renewed but the Institute received a glowing report from Her Majesty's Inspector, which remarked especially on the thorough knowledge of domestic economy possessed by the students. The subject was taught practically in that the students did most of the housework themselves. The reason for this was that the authorities had been horrified by reports that Training Schools in Europe were producing teachers with 'vain and silly airs'. Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth (Secretary of State for Education) was determined that England's teachers should not fall into such sin, so 'as a safeguard against intellectual pride, assumption of superiority, and selfish ambition', the Hockerill students, like their contemporaries in other colleges, set and cleared away their meals, washed dishes, did all the necessary laundry, dusted and polished, and even swept the floors according to a system of rotation. Academically, also, the day was very demanding. The students studied arithmetic, grammar, history and geography as well as doing a great deal of plain needlework and improving their reading and writing, under the supervision of the governesses, who had themselves been trained at the Institute. School practice was done entirely in the practising schools, and criticism lessons, which were given before the whole college, staff and students, were usually held in the Training Room. John Menet's criticism notebook (D/EHk2/7/154) outlines some of these lessons, some students also kept school practice notebooks and Beatrice Lee presented hers to the College (D/EHk7/1/16-18). Much can be learnt about the actual training given and the principles of education taught in the Institution from John Menet's book, practical Hints on Teaching (D/EHk5/1/1-2). (4) The Principal was known as Chaplain until 1897. In 1863 the Reverend John Menet and all his staff except the Lady Superintendent resigned when the Revised Code became law. It became popularly known as the 'payment by results' system. Under the original Code, devised in the late 1850s, teachers' grants, pupil teachers' stipends, teachers' pensions and certain grants to Training Colleges were all abolished. In their place, school managers were offered an attendance grant per child, which was dependent on their passing an examination in reading, writing, arithmetic. A child's failure in any one subject reduced his grant by one third. Even infants of three were examined and so helped the school to continue running. After agitation by Sir Thomas Kay-Shuttleworth and the Reverend John Menet among others, the proposals were revised. Thus the Revised Code laid down that a grant of 4s per pupil was to be paid on attendance, and 8s on attainment measured by examination in the 'three Rs'. Infants were to be exempted from examination. Schools above infant level were to be divided into six 'standards' could earn grant only once in each standard. Teachers had to earn the grant or risk dismissal. The Chaplain and his staff felt unable to work under these terms. Menet's successor was the Reverend A H Blunt. Practical difficulties arose almost immediately since there was no house for the Chaplain, Mr Menet having built his own. A suitable building was therefore erected. Little else of note occurred during the Chaplaincy of Mr Blunt. Report after report comments on the decline in the number and quality of the candidates for admission. In 1871, after a long illness, Mr Blunt died and was replaced by the Reverend A E Northey, who had been elected from a field of sixty candidates. His Chaplaincy was a short one but encompassed the building of the Chapel (see D/EHk2/10), which was opened by the Bishop of St Albans in 1878. In 1881, Mr Northey was replaced by the Reverend R A Oram who was Chaplain for three years. Although Her Majesty's Inspector had been vociferous in his complaints, no improvements had been made, so that by the time the Reverend W J Frere arrived, there was a considerable task ahead. In 1885, the Inspector returned and was much more insistent about recreation and that the fees were too low. Mr Frere raised the fees and introduced the teaching of science. In 1886, the Inspector again reiterated the need for recreation. In 1888, Mrs Claughton, wife of the first Bishop of St Albans determined to raise the necessary \u00a3300 from the ladies of the diocese. The result of this was the construction of the Claughton Room and the Drill Room. In 1897, Mr Frere resigned. He will be remembered as the author of the College hymn set to music by Sir John Stainer (D/EHk2/10/14). In 1896, Hockerill Old Students Association (HOSA) was founded. The subscription was 2s 6d, meetings were to be held twice a year, once in London and once at Hockerill, and each term a 'paper' containing College news was to be issued to members, whose names and addresses were to appear in it annually. This grew into the College magazine (D/EHk4/1). The Cycling Club was founded in 1897 (D/EHk2/12/50) and tennis prospered, stoolball was played in a field adjoining the Principal's house, but there was no hockey until 1901. In 1897 seventy four candidates answered the advertisement for the post of Principal and Chaplain. It was the first and last time that the title was used, all previous Chaplains had been Chaplain only, no later Principal acted as Chaplain. The Committee appointed the Reverend A E Vintner (later known as A E Murray-Aynsley). He instituted a great number of building works and improvements in response to yet another scathing report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate. In 1902 the government decided that grants to Church Training Colleges could only be paid on condition that a certain number of places be thrown open for non-conformist students and the College was in a quandary. Eventually the Committee had to yield to financial necessity. In 1904, therefore, another large building programme was undertaken to accommodate the extra students. School practice was also found to be difficult and some of the students from London were accommodated in London County Council schools. In 1908 the whole year had teaching practice at one time. In 1910 a sanatorium was added and in 1911 the Infants Practising School modernised. The First World War seems to have affected the College in many ways. The students entertained the troops, who were billetted in the area, with concerts and hockey and tennis matches and some of the troops attended Chapel services. The students knitted items to help with the war effort. The danger from air raids meant that the College was blacked out. Students also went to work on the land during their vacation. In 1918 influenza hit Bishop's Stortford so badly that the College was closed and those who were uninfected were sent home. In 1916 His Majesty's Inspectorate had produced another scathing report with a long 'blacklist' of items that needed attention, including lack of space, recreation and other pressing items. In 1920 Mr Murray Aynsley resigned and he was replaced by the first woman Principal, Miss A D Malden. Although many church people objected to this, there was nothing they could do, as in 1917 the Board of Education had declared that all heads of Women's Colleges had to be women. Miss Malden immediately began to work on improving the College and another extensive building programme was undertaken. In 1929 when His Majesty's Inspector came to Hockerill, all the items blacklisted in the 1916 Report had been dealt with, and thus the College was saved from threatened closure. In 1931 the foundation stone was laid by the Bishop of Chelmsford, for the buildings financed by the Board of Supervision (D/EHk6/4/21) and these buildings were opened in 1932 by the Bishop of St Albans, (D/EHk6/4/22). In 1930 Rural Science was added to the curriculum and in 1931 the number of students was increased by the Board of Education from one hundred and thirty three to one hundred and fifty. In 1937 the government again recommended financially 'uneconomic' training colleges for closure, but once again Hockerill escaped. In 1938 Miss Malden retired. Although Hockerill College escaped closure in 1937, several other diocesan training colleges did not. Truro Diocesan Training College was one of those. Its Principal, Miss Pedder, however, was appointed to succeed Miss Malden, when she retired and she assumed her post in 1938. She brought with her a number of Truro students who joined the ranks at Hockerill. HOSA consented to join with the Truro Guild (the Truro Old Students Association) and from 1938 the magazine became known as HOSA (with Truro Guild) Magazine (D/EHk4/1/69ff). The College proceeded through the war coping with the exigencies of blackout and rationing. On 11 October 1940, however, Menet House and St Albans House were bombed and three students lost their lives, St Alban's House was completely demolished and Menet House was declared unsafe. The damage was extensive (D/EHk6/4/14-17, 6/9/12). Once the war was over the builders moved into Hockerill once more (see D/EHk2/2). In 1952 the College celebrated its centenary, culminating in a service at All Saints conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury and a large banquet lunch. The students put on a play called the Smoking Flax. The Minister of Education also attended together with a host of past students (see D/EHk2/10/51, 6/5/1-6, 6/9/19,24-25. 6/10/2-3, 7/2/1-8)/ In 1966 Princess Margaret visited the College to open the buildings erected on the war damaged site. She was, however, taken ill in the middle of the visit and it had to be cut short. (See D/EHk2/10/54, 6/1/3, 6/5/7-8, 6/10/6, 7/2/9-10). In 1969 the College began to try and get its students accepted for B.Ed courses and finally Cambridge University accepted them. The first and last graduation ceremony took place in 1978 (D/EHk7/3/16). By 1973 the College was once again fighting for survival, and a possible merger with Saffron Walden College was negotiated (D/EHk2/4/22-27) but this did not turn out to be a feasible proposition. Between 1974 and 1977 Balls Park College, Hockerill College and Wall Hall College combined to present proposals to the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA) for an upgrading of the course (D/EHk2/8). However, in 1978 Hockerill College was closed and students and staff were transferred to the College of St Mark and St John at Cheltenham.",

        "Title": "ARCHIVE OF THE LORD FAMILY OF NORTHIAM, EAST SUSSEX, AND JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA",
        "Description": "Introduction This archive is principally that of the Lord family from Goteley Manor and Church House, Northiam, in the later 19th and 20th centuries, of their descendants in South Africa from the end of the 19th century, and of members of the Wall family of England, Australia and South Africa, who were related to the Lords by the marriage of Eleanor (Nell) Wall to Arthur Lord in 1904. The papers are those preserved by Arthur Frederic Lord of Johannesburg, South Africa (1869-1942) and his wife Eleanor (Nell) Wall (c1875-c1953), and then by their son Eric Lord (1908-1985) and his wife Claudine. Because they include many letters from England, they are at least as informative about the English family dimension as they are about life in South Africa. The first transfer of papers from South Africa to the East Sussex Record Office was made in 1986, but Eric Lord had visited England before his death, and had made arrangements for his material to have a safe home in his home county. A convenient outline pedigree of the Lord family will be found at AMS 6184/1/2, and in the appendix to this introduction. The Lords had been active in East Sussex since at least the end of the 16th century, though generally as yeoman farmers or as the incumbents of parishes rather than as major landowners. Not only did they produce a prodigious number of clerics, but they often married clergy daughters as well. The earliest ancestor to be noted is Thomas Lord, rector of Ore from 1594 to ?1602, vicar of Salehurst 1596-1640, and rector of Warbleton 1605-1640 (the date of his death). He purchased the advowson of Salehurst in 1621, and his son sold it in 1677 (VCH Sussex 9 224). Thomas's son John Lord (1614-1681) was also the vicar of Salehurst, from 1640 until his death, and rector of Brightling 1663-1681. His tithe account books for both parishes survive (Salehurst 1649-1660, PAR 477 6/1/1 and Brightling 1663-1666, PAR 254 6/7), and the former in particular includes many memoranda of general interest. The Salehurst book features largely in L J Hodson's History of the Parish of Salehurst (1914), where Lord's fondness for litigation to recover his tithes is noted. His 5th child, Thomas Lord (1665-1728), was rector of Ore 1691-1718, and vicar of Ticehurst 1718-1728. This Thomas's 7th child, William Lord (1708-1779), was the first of five successive Lords who were rectors of Northiam from 1749 until 1913. William became rector in 1749 in succession to Thankful Frewen, acquiring the advowson; he was also rector of Salehurst 1772-79. In 1750 he married Frewen's great-niece Mary, daughter of Thomas Frewen of the Church House (Northiam) branch of that family. Thomas died in 1767, when his lands in Northiam and elsewhere descended to his three daughters Mary Lord, Elizabeth Jenkin and Anne Frewen/Buckner. A map of Stent Farm in Northiam and Beckley, 1803 (AMS 5878) records the continuing joint ownership of the estates by their representatives, which was resolved by division only after dispute in 1827/28. Eventually, after some complicated dealings, Goteley and Church House passed to the Lord family (LRD 1/2). The Revd William Lord had twelve children, of whom the eldest, William Lord (1752-1813), was vicar of Salehurst 1772-1779, and then succeeded his father as rector of Northiam (1779-1813). He was unmarried. Some personal accounts, 1786-1801, are preserved in the Frewen archive (FRE 535, 536). Another son was Henry Lord (1760-1836), who was a master at Merchant Taylors School (1783-1796), then rector of Barfreston in Kent (1801-1836), and succeeded his elder brother as rector of Northiam (1813-1836). Henry's son, William Edward Lord (1808-1856) succeeded to the rectory of Northiam (1836-1856), as in turn did the latter's younger brother John Octavus Lord ('Uncle Octy', 1823-1913) (1856-1913). These continuing Northiam connections ensured that this particular branch kept close contact with the Goteley/Church House branch of the Lords described below, and indeed they figure to some extent in the correspondence listed here. In particular, some of the Revd Henry Lord's great-grandchildren lived in South Africa and maintained links with their cousins there (see pedigree notes for details). The eighth son of the Revd William Lord (1708-1779) was George Lord (1762-1843) of Yew Tree, Northiam. A descendant of his eldest son George, a miller of Sellinge, Kent, was Derek Lord of Sandwich (born 1927), whose personal papers are independently deposited at Lewes (AMS 6184), and who is referred to in the papers here as having made contact with the Church House branch in later years (he visited the South African Lords in 1957/58). However, it was the descendants of George's fourth son Edward Lord (1797-1874), tenant of Goteley Manor, Northiam, who mainly figure here, and indeed a few of Edward's own letters survive (LRD 2/1 series). The 1851 census of Northiam records him as a farmer of 225 acres, employing 19 men, and sale particulars of 1858 show his tenure of Goteley and Goddens Farms (XSP 66). Edward married as his second wife Sarah Winser (1797-1874), and they had one child, James Winser Lord (1842-1938), of Church House, Northiam, a prominent local farmer, churchwarden and officeholder. By his first wife Elizabeth Winser (1843-1886) James had five children, all of whom figure to a greater or lesser extent in these papers. James himself, who farmed at Church House until his death at the age of 96, was the author of a number of these letters, as was his second wife Rosa Eliza Batt (1849-1935), a supporter of the women's suffrage movement. A clear picture of the somewhat spartan life at Church House emerges from the letters, which remained the residence after James' death of his two redoubtable spinster daughters Annie (1866-1964), and Gladys (1885-1965). Annie in particular was herself a prolific correspondent, many of whose letters to her brother and nephew in South Africa survive from 1904 to 1961 (shortly before her death at the age of 98). They are particularly graphic concerning the billetting, etc, of troops in the 2nd World War (she commented in 1940 that 'we are.. fit & very ferocious & feel quite ready to kill a Hun ourselves'). Unfortunately the return letters from South Africa to Northiam do not survive, since Annie destroyed them during the last war to prevent their falling into enemy or other undesirable hands. The Church House Lords kept close contact with their Frewen relatives of Brickwall. Of the three sons of James Winser Lord, the eldest, Edward (1864-1946) married in 1891 (to the family's displeasure) a maidservant called Ada, and went to live and farm in Kansas, U.S.A. His relations thereafter with Northiam were strained (though not completely broken). However, he wrote a few very long letters (LRD 20 series) to his brother Arthur in South Africa, which are almost a caricature of American homespun folksiness, and convey a clear picture of the spread and activities of his family. Another son was Moreton (1867-1958), who worked in partnership with his father for a time, living for some years at Goteley Manor, but he also contracted a marriage deemed unsuitable particularly by his step-mother and sisters, and relationships deteriorated. The partnership was effectively over by the late 1920's. No letters from Moreton survive here. Moreton's adopted son Robert was the last representative of the Lord family to live in Northiam (though relatives of the name abound elsewhere). It was the third son, Arthur Frederic (1869-1942) who moved to South Africa. Educated at Clifton House School, Eastbourne (1879-1886), he was apprenticed for four years to George Fletcher & Co., an engineering firm in Derbyshire (1886-1890), before going out to South Africa in 1890. Here he worked as an engineer for mining companies, becoming based in Johannesburg in 1891 (and thus one of the earliest settlers there). In 1895 he served in 'Bettington's Horse', at the time of the Jameson Raid. It was disbanded the following year. Then he worked for a time in Johannesburg (mainly for Edelstein's), until in 1899 he joined the Rhodesia Regiment under Baden Powell and Plumer, and was wounded by being shot in the arm near the River Limpopo. Returning to England in 1900 to recuperate, he was shipwrecked two days out when the Mexican ran aground, and lost most of his possessions. It is from this point that most of his letters and papers survive, and he returned to Johannesburg to resume his career as a mining engineer. In 1903 he met Nell Wall (see below), newly arrived to seek her errant brothers, and the two were married in 1904 Initially they lived at 'Northiam' (or 'Northiam Lodge'), 104 Regent Street, Belle Vue, Johannesburg (though Arthur was often away lodging in mine houses), and their first child Joan was born in 1905. Because this was a difficult birth Nell returned to England in 1908 for the birth of Eric; and they had a third child Peter in 1917. The family moved in October 1912 to a new house at 'Northiam', 5th Avenue, Florida (Johannesburg), and in July 1916 to 30 Yeo Street, Yeoville, in the Linden area of Johannesburg. Later they moved to a small farm at Linden (the formal address was on Third Avenue), where the family lived for several years. This last expanded on Nell's early attempts to supplement their income by poultry rearing, etc, and they became involved in fruit production, especially of peaches. Much of the material here was assembled by Arthur and Nell Lord, and represents their correspondence and papers as passed on to their son Eric (below). Although it throws quite a lot of light on their life (and that of relations) in South Africa, much of the correspondence is that sent to South Africa by family and friends in England. In particular (as noted above) there are many letters from their Lord relatives at Northiam, so one gets at least as good a commentary on life there between about 1904 and 1960 as one does about local affairs. The South African Lords also visited England on various occasions. The letters are listed in detail, and it is their cumulative effect, rather than any single dramatic item, which paints a fascinating picture of an emigrant family, of their relations with home, and of their unselfconscious attitudes to the politics and issues of the day. Not least, the letters illustrate the economic tightrope which such families (at both ends of the correspondence) had to walk in pre-social security days. Arthur himself died suddenly in 1942; his widow lived on at Linden with Eric until her death in c1953. Of the other two children, Joan attended Roedean School at Park Town, Johannesburg. She trained in dancing in England (visiting her relations at Church House and elsewhere), but in 1932 married Kenneth Fernsby, and they settled in Southern Rhodesia to grow tobacco. They had two children, but ran into difficulties because Kenneth developed Parkinson's Disease. Her brother Peter developed mental problems and lived at home until in due course he had to be cared for professionally; he died in c1962. Eric Lord (1908-1985) attended Park Town School, Mountain View, Johannesburg. Before the last War he seems to have lived at Linden assisting with the farm (since Arthur was often away at the mines). Latterly, however, he worked as an accountant with the United Tobacco Companies (South) Ltd of Cape Town. Called up in 1940 for service in the South African Air Force, he continued studying for professional qualifications, and was still based in South Africa when his father died (so he was on hand to help his mother for a time). In 1943 he was posted to North Africa (mainly Tunisia), and later the same year was in Italy. He was mentioned in dispatches in 1944, shortly before returning to South Africa. Many letters from or to Eric survive from this period, and indeed form the biggest single group to throw light on him and his life, but one has to read between the lines to discover much about the war itself, because of censorship restrictions. After his father's death Eric maintained regular contact with Northiam (mainly Annie Lord), and the correspondence goes on to 1961, but the later period is less well documented than the early days. A year or so before his death he and his wife Claudine visited Lewes seeking a home for the family papers, a proposal which was warmly welcomed, and whose result is seen here. There was more than one side to the correspondence, however, since it also concerns the family of Arthur Lord's wife Nell (Eleanor Maud), who was born in about 1875, the seventh child of Thomas Robert Whowall and his wife Sarah (Poole). The father was proprietor of a cab company in the Shepherds Bush/Hammersmith area of London. All the children (ten in all) figure in one way or another in the correspondence, and their world-wide contacts with each other (sometimes sketchy) add considerably to the interest of the archive. They all used the form Wall for their surname, as a modification of Whowall. Briefly, they were: Ada (or 'Sir', c1858-1928); married Col. William Moir and lived at Sidmouth. Thomas (Tom, born 1860); an actor in England. James (Jim, born c1862); emigrated to Australia and became a bookmaker; he had a family. William ('Tosh', born c1865); emigrated to Australia and became a bookmaker. Emma ('Em', c1869-1949); married Fred Bunting and had a family who figure in the correspondence; she lived latterly in Kent. Henry (Harry or 'Brown', c1872-1912); emigrated to Australia but died early of diabetes; he had a family Eleanor (Nell); married Arthur Lord Minnie (Min or 'Black', born c1875); a repertory actress in England. Percy (1881, living 1950); became a mining engineer in South Africa, later a farmer, who (with his wife Beatrice or Bea) kept close contact with Arthur and Nell in the earlier years. Frank (1884-1951); a mining employee in South Africa who appears to have returned to England after the First World War. Nell's own early story is astonishing. In 1898, at the age of 23, worrying that the family had lost contact with the three Australian brothers, she went there to find them and restore communication before returning to London. By 1900 her immediately younger brother Percy had gone to South Africa and was serving in the Boer War, where he was joined in 1901 by the youngest brother Frank, who had hated school, and subsequently found that life at sea was not for him. Both brothers sought employment after the war in diamond mining in South Africa, though Percy was to serve for a time in the Natal Police. Both brothers were to try Australia as an alternative, but returned to South Africa and mining. In 1903 Nell became worried about the two, and set off for South Africa to trace them. Here she met and married Arthur Lord, and her story becomes merged with that family. She kept a sisterly eye on Percy and Frank for some time, however, and extensive correspondence with them (and with Percy's wife Beatrice, an Australian, whom he married in 1909) exists down to the end of the First World War. Both Percy and Frank served in British regiments in the War, Percy being injured and subsequently returning to farm cattle in Natal. Correspondence with both brothers dropped considerably thereafter (or at least does not survive). Nell kept up to some extent with her three sisters, though the longest connection seems to have been with the family of her sister Emma. This was both through correspondence and through visits to England, but Minnie visited her in South Africa in 1910. The family's connection with the Frewens, both as relatives and neighbours, has resulted in a great many references to the Lords in the Frewen archive, ESRO FRE. It must be said that the Frewens were frequently antagonistic to the Lords, and in particular the Revd William Lord (1752-1813) and his son the Revd Henry Lord (1760-1836) aroused the ire of contemporary Frewens. For examples, see FRE 2265 (William Lord 'more mad than ever' after a tithe-dispute, c1810), FRE 2157 (Henry Lord 'a great scamp', 1790) and FRE 2176 (Charles Lord 'a beastly inhabitant and such a disagreeable neighbour', 1807). In 1851 Elizabeth Lord, wife of the Revd William Edward Lord (1808-1856), made transcripts of letters from members of the Frewen family to the Revd William Lord. The transcripts are now in the Frewen archive, FRE 847; the originals are no longer in the Lord archive.\nArrangement: Family Papers LRD 1/1 Pedigree Papers LRD 1/2 Legal Papers LRD 1/3 Personal Papers Family Correspondence LRD 2/1-34 The Lord Family LRD 2/35-42 The Wall Family Photographs LRD 3/1 Church House, Northiam, & the Lord Family in England LRD 3/2 Arthur & Nell Lord and family (mainly South Africa) LRD 3/3 South African Mining LRD 3/4 Eric & Claudine Lord LRD 3/5 The American Lords LRD 3/6 The Wall Family LRD 3/7 Negatives LRD 3/8 Modern Prints from Negatives LRD 3/9 South African Photographs and Views LRD 3/10 English Views",

        "Title": "Letter from John H. G. Oglander, Nunwell, Brading, I.W., to Edith Ogle, his sister in law",
        "Description": "'I almost despair of doing any good but you may think that I intend to be rude, if I don't answer yours of 6th. Your feeling that no arrangements were made for you to meet Auberon may have contributed to vex you, so perhaps it is worthwhile to explain that in May he did not arrive in London until the afternoon of the Friday and as we had but one sitting room, it had been arranged that he should take Joan to introduce her to his mother and sisters in Bruton Street. Our dinner that night was a scramble, while Florence and Joan were dressing for the Court and I could not have asked him to dine to meet you - for I had to take Joan off to the photographers and had hardly time to dress for the Court myself. On Saturday morning you were leaving London but he came to the hotel to see you - when - you did not wish him joy and I believe hardly spoke to him. [Joan Oglander was presented to the King and Queen on Friday 8 May, and Edith left London the following morning]. Since that [sic] until last week he has never known for certain when he could come from Salisbury Plain. His visits have been for 1 or 2 days - snatched when he could get away from duty to see Joan and we had short notice and Joan often disappointed. Last week was regatta week when you have not usually been asked to come to us because we have generally filled up with young people who like our rough sort of yachting - or had access to the Squadron Garden. It would have been a very poor compliment to invite you when we could not have managed for you to enjoy the week. Your invitation to Auberon was refused simply because he could not with any certainty get leave. Your first letters in April [when Joan became engaged] were very kind and natural and when you expressed objections in London was the first time I fancied you did not share our feelings Since that when we wrote of Auberon we noticed in your replies that if you mentioned him at all, you spoke formally of 'Captain Kennard', but what more could we have possibly done hither to to make you better acquainted than you were in Eaton Place - (since he could not get leave) - I cannot see. Perhaps you don't know how closely an officer has to stick to his work now. I am sorry you have made yourself ill - your answer to my first letter caused Florence a heart attack from which she has not yet recovered. Your mother told me before I married that Florence was 'the sweetest tempered child a mother could wish' and after 24 years I can use the same words of her as a wife, that yr. mother used of her as a daughter. She has been 'party' to no 'scheme'. There has been no scheme excepting in your imagination. I wrote to ask you if you wanted the house and you answered (in effect) that you did not know - but the Hammonds might let it otherwise. We had been trying for other houses and lost the only one within our means, by being a few hours late. We took the Hammonds until February, but on your saying you had it as early as January last year - I offered to leave as early in January as we possibly could after the wedding - but that did not please you. As to your remarks on a visit to Cadenabbia nearly twenty years ago, I do remember unhappiness and I also remember the visits to Pallanza and Venice which caused it - but I don't see that it can help to clear the air now - to rake up old differences of so long ago. If you had felt hurt at no further arrangement being made for you to meet Auberon - I can assure you that we have been most anxious for you to meet and like him - and the difficulty in meeting has been solely because he has never known when he could get more than a few hours leave - Florence's first wish when he got his staff appointment was to tell you and she wrote at once to interest you. I asked Ogle to find another trustee because you both repeatedly say I have used 'sharp practice' and not because I wanted to put him to any inconvenience' (103/101)",

        "Description": "Records of West Sussex Record Office Additional Manuscripts INTRODUCTION This is the forty fifth volume of Additional Manuscripts (Add Mss) to have been catalogued in the West Sussex Record office and it has been compiled, in general, along the lines indicated in the introduction to the first volume in November 1956 The class of Additional Manuscripts embraces all the smaller gifts and deposits of documents received by the West Sussex Record Office, as distinct from the large family and estate collections, such as Goodwood Add Mss; or accumulations from solicitors' offices, such as Oglethorpe and Anderson Add Mss; collections of official bodies, such as Quarter Sessions records; or collections from other bodies, such as the records of the Royal Sussex Regiment, each of which is referred to and quoted by name. The majority of Additional Manuscripts have been deeds of title, though increasingly a healthy balance of a vast range of other original material has been catalogued in these volumes. However the pressure of the sheer weight of material to be catalogued has meant that since volume 29 in March 1983, the catalogues of title deeds, instead of being the detailed calendars that had been prepared until that date, have mainly been summary lists, with the emphasis being placed on the property concerned in the transaction, rather than on the parties involved, or the technicalities of the type of legal conveyance being used. From the thirty sixth volume in November 1987, the accession number of each collection catalogued is given at the head of each separate catalogue The documents listed in this catalogue range in date from a Court Roll of the Manor of Sullington, 1425 (Add Mss 48,269) to the latest of Douglas Lasseter's log books of his Sussex walks in March 1996 (Add Mss 48,532). As well as the usual deeds of title, there are manorial records, such as those for the manors of St. John's Midhurst, 1559-1585 and Lodsworth, 1581 (Add Mss 48,163-48,164); Sullington, 1425 (Add Mss 48,269); and Selsey, 1843-1923 (Add Mss 48,565-48,567); and maps, including those for farms in Horsham, 1768 (Add Mss 48,149); West Grinstead, 1835 (Add Mss 48,263); Albourne, Durrington, Haywards Heath and Hurstpierpoint, 1679-1873 (Add Mss 48,358-48,363); Broadwater, Billingshurst, Heene and Goring, 1748-1806 (Add Mss 48,403-48,406) and South Mundham, 1637 (Add Mss 48,568).

Founded by Dr William Cleaver, with John Webster and Henry Vickers, and supported by voluntary subscription, its appearance caused some opposition, since Sheffield already sustained three voluntary hospitals. After preliminary meetings in 1876 to enlist promises of support, a three-year lease was taken out on Brightmore House, 222-224 Brookhill, with the aims to treat sick children; to gain and spread knowledge of childhood diseases; to give advice to the poorer classes for the better care of children in both sickness and health; to train women as children& apos;s nurses. It originally only treated out-patients; 45 were treated from 15 November to 31 December. In June 1877 the hospital, with eight beds, was opened to in-patients and 29 were taken in during that year. Shares in two additional sources of income were made available to the hospital: in 1878 it was admitted to the Hospital Saturday Fund (weekly subscriptions collected from factories and works) and in 1879 to the Hospital Sunday Fund (annual church collections). As demand grew, the inadequacies of the premises became obvious and two houses were purchased for new accommodation at 267 and 269 Western Bank, to which the hospital moved in September 1880, when it also changed its name to the & apos;Children& apos;s Hospital& apos;. Extensions were built in 1888 and 1896, and a new out-patient and administrative block, replacing the two original houses, followed in 1903. The hospital then had 50 beds for in-patients and over 2,000 out-patients were treated every year; demand continually grew: in 1921 878 in-patients and 4,768 out-patients were treated. Links were forged with the University from its very founding in 1905, with students taking courses taught by hospital house surgeons. The Department of Child Health was established in 1947. Further extensions and wards were added in 1906 and 1920. Later developments and running costs were largely funded with the proceeds of money amassed by the Penny in the Pound Scheme, set up in 1921 by the Sheffield Joint Hospitals Council; more extensions followed in 1959, 1964 and 1972. An additional first phase development in the 1980s was completed and opened by the Princess of Wales in 1989. A second phase was completed in 1999 and its extensive departments and units include the City& apos;s Accident and Emergency Department for children, moved from the Northern General Hospital in 1994. Other establishments: In 1893 the East End Branch Hospital in the Wicker (Nursery Street) was opened as a branch of the Sheffield Children& apos;s Hospital , with the original aim of treating both out-patients and in-patients. It was founded by deed of endowment of 1891 which set up the Sheffield Children& apos;s Hospital Special Fund. A new out-patients department and administration block were opened in 1903, and two new wards were opened in 1927. It closed in 1931, following the order of the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, 1930. Its trustees were discharged from duty and the income of its endowments and its management were transferred to the Sheffield Children& apos;s Hospital. Its name was preserved by naming a separate ward at the Children& apos;s Hospital & apos;The Eastern Ward& apos; and reserving it for patients from the east end of Sheffield. Thornbury Annexe (in 1976 renamed & apos;The Children& apos;s Hospital, Thornbury& apos;) in Fulwood Road was a medical annexe, isolation ward and convalescent home for the Children& apos;s Hospital. Purchased in 1947, it opened in 1951 with 50 beds and continued in use until 1982, after which it was sold by the trustees of the former United Sheffield Hospitals for development as a private hospital. Ryegate Annexe (in 1976 renamed & apos;The Children& apos;s Hospital, Ryegate) in Manchester Road, a continuation hospital and convalescent home, was donated to the Children& apos;s Hospital in 1936. It is now (2006) known as Ryegate Children& apos;s Centre. Other care locations currently are: Beighton Community Hospital; Centenary House; Flocton House; Oakwood Young People& apos;s Centre; Shirle Hill Hospital; St Peter& apos;s Close. Administration: As a voluntary hospital, management was vested in a board of governors who annually elected a chairman. At the introduction of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948 (National Health Service Act, 1946), the Children& apos;s Hospital and the other former voluntary hospitals in Sheffield were brought together for administrative purposes into one group as The United Sheffield Hospitals, under a Board of Governors. This was abolished at the reorganisation of the NHS in 1974 when Sheffield Area Health Authority (Teaching) was established as one of the health areas within the new Trent Regional Health Authority. From 1974 to 1978 the Children& apos;s Hospital was in the Central (Teaching) District of SAHA. Following SAHA& apos;s redistricting exercise in summer 1978, the hospital was put into the Southern (Teaching) District, as was Ryegate hospital. Further reorganisation of the NHS in 1982 abolished one tier of management, and responsiblity for the hospital& apos;s administration was thus brought under Sheffield Health Authority of Trent Regional Health Authority. In the internal market created in 1991 the HAs purchased services from the hospitals which, following the NHS and Community Care Act, 1990, were encouraged to become self-governing trusts. The hospital gained trust status in 1992 as Sheffield Children& apos;s Hospital NHS Trust, later dropping the name & apos;Hospital& apos; to reflect the changed emphasis of drawing together hospital, community paediatrics and mental health. The Trust is managed by the Trust Board of non-executive and executive Directors, supported by a Council of Governors, and a Membership Community. The responsibility for operational and financial management of the Trust is shared between members of the Corporate Management Team. Foundation status was achieved on 1 August 2006 and as Sheffield Children& apos;s NHS Foundation Trust it has greater autonomy to manage its own affairs. Trent RHA was replaced in 1996 by NHS Executive Trent. That too was abolished in 2002 when South Yorkshire Strategic Health Authority was set up, which itself was merged with other SHAs to form Yorkshire and the Humber Strategic Health Authority in July 2006.",

H Lee J Jones (LJ) was born in Runcorn in May 1869 to Anglo-American parents. His early ambition to become a clergyman was thwarted when the family suffered financial difficulties and he was forced to enter the printing business. His desire to help those less fortunate than himself led to the setting up of the Liverpool Food Association in May 1893, which provided school-children with low cost dinners - an idea that was soon copied by other cities. By 1898 the work had expanded to improve the quality of life for the poor as well as to feed them. Alley concerts and trips to New Brighton were among the treats organised by the newly christened Food and Betterment Association. The staff of the Association were known as the League of Welldoers and in 1908 the organisation became known by this title. LJ devoted the rest of his life to helping others both through the League and personally. He led campaigns, such as the movement to exempt charities from paying rates, and the greater use of corporal punishment for children. He put forward strong personal opinions through his own publications, The Welldoer and Straight Talk, and Liverpool papers, using the pen name of 'Delphian'. His funeral procession in October 1936 went along streets that were lined by thousands who wanted to acknowledge their gratitude and respect for LJ and his lifetime of caring. After his death the organisation was incorporated and continued under the new warden and secretary, WJ Horn, until his retirement in 1980. A new centre was completed in Limekiln Lane in 1972 and the work continues today, concentrating on youth services and care of the elderly. LJ's interests were varied and this is reflected in the records. As well as a very large amount of personal papers and correspondence to friends, those he helped, and officials, there are original mss of writers whom he befriended and many press cuttings about varying subjects. Official LWD papers are mixed in with his personal papers and it is often difficult to separate the man and his work. The archive was deposited on 2 main occasions - on 7/2/1977 (1977-7) and 1/6/1977 (1977-34) by WJ Horn, Warden and Secretary, League of Welldoers, Limekiln Lane, Liverpool, on permanent loan. There ia a total of 43 boxes. NB: The first deposit appears to have been fully listed, but the second seems to have been listed by box only and not in any order. This new list is based on these two originals but has been made more accessible mainly by providing a more detailed summary of contents (see next page). The detailed list of personal correspondence (/11-/20) from the old list has been retained within the body of this new list and should be used in conjunction with the LWD personal name index in the Searchroom. An appendix of major collections of press cuttings, leaflets and articles, publications and official reports (i.e. printed or published material) within the archive can be found at the end of the list.

Mr Jones This is a brief account of the Rev. Thomas Jones, the reader is referred to the Rev. John Owen's biography of him published in 1851. The Rev. Smith does quote the Rev.

She grew up in Hawkhurst, Kent, in the house of Oakfield. She was educated at home, before studying for one year at Belstead School in Suffolk. After her education was completed she, alongside her sisters, helped in the community. In 1872, Constance Maynard left to study at Hitchin College, and moved with the college to Cambridge to become Girton College, in 1873. She was the first Girton student to study the Moral Sciences tripos and in 1875 received a second class honours degree. Whilst at Girton she established a group called Girton Prayer Group. After leaving Girton, due to problems in the family business, Constance Maynard was allowed to accept an invitation from Frances Dove to join the staff of Cheltenham Ladies' College. In 1877 she left with her colleague and friend Louisa Lumsden to establish St Leonard's School, at St Andrews, where Lumsden was head. During her three years (1877-1880) here, she rejected offers of headships, including that of her former school Belstead. She also hesitatingly refused a marriage proposal from Scottish Minister Dr James Robertson. In 1880 she moved to London with her brother and studied part time at the Slade School of Art. Whilst studying here she became involved with a group of individuals including Major Charles Hamilton Malan, Ann Dudin Brown and and Caroline Cavendish, with the shared aim of establishing a ladies' college. All with varying ideas of how the college should proceed, Constance Maynard was an integral part of forming the plans for her ideal college - to prepare ladies for the London degree, based on Christian principles. The group first met for discussions in February 1882, and in May Constance Maynard was offered the position of Mistress (a title borrowed from Girton), and in October of that year, Westfield College opened in two private houses in Hampstead. She remained Mistress of Westfield for thirty-three years, retiring in 1913, leaving Westfield as a securely established school of the University of London. She had taught around five hundred students, and many were successful working in schools, colleges and for missionary organisations. She kept in close contact with her old students through letters and visits, and maintained strong relationships with them. The money they collected as a parting gift she donated to the college; some was used as a hardship fund, the remainder as endowment for the Maynard divinity lectures. In 1888 Maynard adopted a child of Italian extraction, through a friend in the Salvation Army. At the time of her adoption Stephan\u00eb Anthon, known as Effie, was eight years old, and the relationship between them was a tumultuous one. Whilst Constance continued to support Effie until her death in 1915, from tuberculosis, it is detailed in her diaries as a period of disappoint. Religious movements, from the Salvation Army to the Modern Churchmen's Union, figure prominently in the life of Constance Maynard. She was elected as old students' representative to the governing body of Girton and served from 1897 to about 1905 on the council of the Church Schools' Society. She also traveled extensively around the world; to South Africa, the Holy Land, Canada, Europe, and by bicycle throughout the British Isles. After her retirement, Constance Maynard spent her time travelling, receiving visitors, reading and writing. She wrote poetry, including four volumes of War poems, lectures, particularly Divinity lectures, and pamphlets of a moral nature on subjects such as temperance. Her published works include 'Between College Terms' (1910); 'The Life of Dora Greenwell' (1926); 'From an early Victorian schoolroom to the university', Nineteenth Century, November 1914; contributions to The Hibbert Journal and other religious periodicals; and numerous tracts and pamphlets. Her unpublished writings include an unfinished autobiography, composed at intervals between 1915 and 1927. Constance Maynard died at her home, The Sundial, Marsham Way, Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, on 26 March 1935, and was buried at Gerrards Cross parish church on 29 March. Under her will the college received \u00a31500 to fund an entrance scholarship.\nArrangement: This collection has been arranged by function, chronologically, and where possible respecting the original order of the records. It has been divided into 9 series; Greenbook Diaries; Diaries; Sundial Diaries; Travel Diaries and Notebooks; Diaries regarding Effie [Stephan\u00eb Anthon]; Autobiography; Writings by Constance Maynard; Writings by Family and Friends; and Personal Memorabilia.",

        "Title": "Accounts and other records of J. Millburn and Son, auctioneers and valuers, of Aylesbury",
        "Description": "Large Volumes a) Journal, 1939-50 This was used to record day-by-day transactions, prior to entering in the ledgers. (N.B. Double-entry book-keeping was not used: the entries are in simple chronological order.) Foolscap, 602 numbered pages. Half-leather bound. b) Ledger 'F', 1934-50 (i.e. the sixth since the founding of the business) This is a general ledger containing the Trade Account, Auction Mart Account, personal accounts of regular customers, rent accounts, etc. During the 1930s it was usual for an appreciable proportion of the goods in the fortnightly auction sales to belong to the firm. Most of these originated at the auction sales of Messrs. Tooth & Tooth, London, which were attended regularly by Mr. B.J.Millburn; purchases at these sales are entered in the Auction Mart pages as 'T & T', and the expenses of fetching them from London to Aylesbury are entered under the removers' names, e.g. 'Dayton' or 'Bezant'. From June 1934, following the death of John Millburn, Miss C.B.Millburn was employed as clerk; her wages (initially 7s. 6d. per week) are entered in the Trade Account under 'CBM'. No.6 Temple Street was occupied by Mr. Bandy, who was employed on a part-time basis by John Millburn as a gardener/handyman as well as in the saleroom. Entries for 'Labour' or 'Wages' in the Trade Account are for part-time employees, generally employed as porters on sale days only. During the second world war the value of the turnover increased considerably, due partly to price increases in general and partly to increased volume of business (new goods being in short supply). Visits to Tooth & Tooth ceased towards the end of 1941, but this may have been due to that firm being bombed. From the middle of 1940, Mr. Millburn was able to put some of the profits into Savings Certificates and Defence Bonds; these were his personal investments, though the details are entered in the general ledger for convenience. In 1942, membership of a professional organisation became obligatory. Mr. B.J.Millburn's subscriptions to the Incorporated Society of Auctioneers and Landed Property Agents are entered in the Trade Account in May 1942 and subsequently each January. Nearly all the entries in this ledger are in Mr. B.J. Millburn's hand, up to March 1950; the few subsequent entries are in Miss C.B.Millburn's hand. The 'Wages' entries for sales nos. 1680-3 include a fee to Mr. L.H.Dix, who conducted these in Mr. Millburn's absence due to illness. Foolscap, 162 numbered pages plus index. Half-leather bound. c) Storage Ledger, 1917-50 About 1914, John Millburn purchased the Church Hall at Thame, Oxon, a building mainly of wood and asbestos with a corrugated iron roof, and had it moved to the garden of his private house, [58] Bierton Hill. This building was used for storage of furniture etc., and for repairs. This ledger records the income from storage charges, arranged under names of owners. Foolscap, 167 numbered pages plus index. Half-leather bound. Smaller Volumes and Bundles of Papers D/139/) Auction Book No.1 This contains details of auction sales from the founding of the business in 1878 to September 1879; all the entries are in John Millburn's hand. The sales included those held at various inns, in the Corn Exchange, the Market Square, etc. as well as in the hired room in St. Mary's Square which was the firm's regular auction room at that time. 8vo, 327 pp., cloth bound. Partly damaged by water. D/139/2 Trading Summaries, 1931-4 These few pages, removed from a book subsequently used for private household accounts, summarize the trading income and expenditure for the last three financial years before John Millburn died in 1934. They indicate that during this period, John Millburn drew \u00a33 per week, and Bowness John Millburn \u00a35 per week; any surplus at the end of the year was divided equally. (Though the younger partner, B.J.M. was doing most of the work during this period, when his father was over 80.) 16 pages 8vo, disbound. D/139/3 Valuation Books, 1922-50 (2) These contain details of valuations of house contents, jewellery, etc., and of a few houses, mostly undertaken for administration or probate. Some of the entries are in code, the ten-letter word used for this purpose being 'patterdale', viz: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 p a t T e r d A l E The use of both 'e' and 'l' in handwriting could lead to confusion, but in practice this was not significant as the figure '9' seldom occurred in valuations except in totals. Pages 104-111 of the 1923-37 book contain the valuation for division of John Millburn's effects following his death in 1934. Two books, 8' x 5', bound at short edge, openings numbered 1-129. Leather, with clasp. D/139/4 Unpaid Book, 1936-50 This contains the names of buyers and sellers whose accounts were not settled before the next sale, including 'bad debts'. 9\u00bd' x 6\u00bd', openings 1-95 numbered in MS. Half-leather bound. D/139/5 Rough Draft Annual Accounts, 1941.1950 Following John Millburn's death in June 1934, the firm's accounting year ended on 15 June. These sheets are the rough draft copies of the annual accounts submitted to the Income Tax office. They indicate that the firm's taxable profit during these years was as follows:- Year ended Income 'Expenditure' (includes annual value of premises) Gross Profit before tax 15. 6. 1942 \u00a31,234 \u00a3354 \u00a3880 15. 6. 1943 missing, see Ledger 'F' 15. 6. 1944 missing, see Ledger 'F' 15. 6. 1945 \u00a31,741 \u00a3333 \u00a31,408 15. 6. 1946 \u00a32,029 \u00a3378 \u00a31,651 15. 6. 1947 \u00a31,763 \u00a3491 \u00a31,272 15. 6. 1948 \u00a31,714 \u00a3485 \u00a31,229 15. 6. 1949 \u00a31,353 \u00a3511 \u00a3841 15. 6. 1950 \u00a31,340 \u00a3493 \u00a3847 Seven double-foolscap sheets, some with Income Tax acknowledgement letter attached.

D/139/11 Bank Statements, 1946-50 These statements are for Mr. B.J.Millburn's only account, combining his business and private interests. 20 sheets. D/139/12 Auction Books, 1949-50 (3) These books contain details of the lots, owners, buyers, and prices realized for sales held during 1949 and the first half of 1950; they are the last three in the series which commenced in 1878 with Auction Book No.1 (item 1). The method of use was as follows. During the lotting process, Mr. Millburn would call out the description of each lot as he stuck a number on it, and this would be written by the clerk (Miss C.B.Millburn) against the lot number on the left-hand page. Printed catalogues were not issued during the period to which these books refer, but a typed catalogue was pinned to a board in the Auction Room for customers' reference. The owners' names were entered in the first column on the right-hand page. Pre-sale commissions, and reserves, were entered on the left-hand page as a reminder to the auctioneer. At the sale, the price realized was entered on the right-hand page by the auctioneer, together with the name of the buyer. After the sale, the prices were totalled for each owner on each page, and transferred to the 'Summary' entries following the sale pages, where the commission and any other deductions were also entered. Details of buyers were entered in separate books, one for each sale (see item 13). The commission charged during this period was basically 10% of the hammer price, plus a lotting charge of 6d per lot, rounded off to the nearest 6d. These charges were borne by the vendors - the 'buyers' premium' had not been invented then. The entries for lot descriptions and summaries are in Miss C.B.Millburn's hand, while those for buyers' names and prices are in Mr. B.J.Millburn's hand except for the last four sales (1680-3). The auctioneer for these was Mr. L.H.Dix, of Messrs. W.Brown & Co., who was engaged to conduct these sales during Mr. Millburn's illness. 3 books, 8' x 5', approx. 140 openings each. Limp cloth. D/139/13 Buyers' Books, 1949-50 (34) In these books the buyers' names are entered alphabetically (by first letter only), with lot numbers and prices. A separate book was used for each sale. Most of the entries in these books were made by the sale clerk (Miss C.B.Millburn) during the sale, so that immediately after its conclusion buyers could pay for their purchases and take them away. 34 books, 6\u00bc' x 4', 72 pp. each, stapled in paper covers. D/139/14 Documents relating to former employees These two bundles contain documents relating to the administration of the estates of S.H.Green and J.Edwards, former employees of J.Millburn & Son, for which Mr. B.J.Millburn was the executor. Two bundles, v. sizes, including probate copies of wills. 15) Documents relating to No.11 Abbotts Road, Aylesbury Sometime in the 1930s Mr. B.J. Millburn's sister, Mrs. E.C. Alderson, purchased No.11 Abbotts Road as an investment. The house passed to her son, the Rev. C.W. Alderson, on her death in 1936. It was requisitioned during the Second World War for the use of the Fire Service. These documents relate to the sale of the house to the County Council in 1949. Details of rent paid, and outgoings, are in Ledger 'F'. A bundle of letters etc., v. sizes. D/139/16 Stationery Examples of printed stationery used by the firm. Various sizes. D/139/17 Documents relating to the sale of the firm's premises, 1950 Due to progressively worsening health, the business was run down by Mr. B.J. Millburn during the first half of 1950, and closed in June. These documents relate to the sale of the warehouse in Silver Lane, and the premises in Cambridge Street. Some press cuttings are included. A bundle of letters etc., v. sizes; press cuttings; sale catalogue of W. Brown & Co. including the office furniture. D/139/18 Miscellaneous documents and photographs This file contains various items which do not fit into any of the above categories, viz.- Notes re licences to deal in gold & silver plate. Tenancy agreement with V.H. Jarvis, part of first floor, 1907. Tenancy agreement with David Jones, 1949. Endorsement to insurance policy for 5 Cambridge Street, 1907.

Millburn, March 1982.\nAdministrative history: Notes on the firm of J.MILLBURN & SON, Auctioneers & Valuers, Aylesbury, 1878-1950 The business was founded in 1878 by John Millburn (1844-1934), and was continued after his death by his second son, Bowness John Millburn (1879-1950), and grand-daughter, Miss Cecily Barbara Millburn (1915-1975). It closed in June 1950 due to Mr. B.J.Millburn's ill-health; he died a few months later. John Millburn was born in Bierton, the only son of a baker, George Millburn (1805-1885). He attended the village schools at Bierton and (from 1855) Hardwick, and was subsequently articled to a firm of surveyors in Aylesbury. In 1868 he married Anne Bateman, daughter of a Penrith printer, who was then a teacher at St. Mary's National School, Aylesbury. When he started his own business in 1878, at the age of 34, he rented an office in Silver Street and a warehouse in the yard of the Derby Arms inn, St. Mary's Square. At that time his wife was headmistress of St. John's National School, Cambridge Street, and Mr. Millburn lived with his wife and three children (a boy and two girls) at 'St. John's Parsonage' adjoining the school. His second son, Bowness John, was born there in 1879. In the early years of the business, Mr. Millburn held auction sales not only in his Derby Arms room, but also in the Market Square, in the Corn Exchange, and at various local inns. In 1880 a number of properties in the town centre, formerly in the possession of W.Y.Purssell, were sold by the latter's executors. Mr. Millburn purchased a house, shop, and yard, No.5 Cambridge Street, then occupied by a plumber and glazier. These were demolished, and a new building erected by Thomas Green. The new premises contained an entrance lobby, office, auction room, and kitchen on the ground floor, and a living room and three or four bedrooms above. (A second storey was added later.) Mr. Millburn and his family moved here in 1881, and their old home was demolished to make way for St. John's Church. His last child, Michael Charles, later a well-known photographer in the town, was born here in 1882. The first sale at the 'New Auction Rooms' was held in April 1881, and from May that year sales of Household Furniture & Effects were held regularly on the first and third Wednesdays in every month. This pattern continued through two world wars up to the closure of the business in 1950. Extra sales were sometimes held when there were five Wednesdays in a month, and on other occasions when business required them. The upper floors of 5 Cambridge Street ceased to be used for residential purposes in 1896, when a new house was built for Mr. Millburn on Bierton Hill (later No.58). For a few years the upper floors were used as offices and showrooms, but this proved too inconvenient and in 1907 the rooms over the auction room were let to Mr. V.H.Jarvis, who constructed a bridge giving access from the first floor of his premises in the High Street. The staircase and rooms at the western end were retained by Mr. Millburn and used mainly for storage. This remained the situation until the business closed, when the entire premises were bought by V.H.Jarvis Ltd. and incorporated into their greatly-enlarged department store. It was Mr. David Jones's intention eventually to rebuild all the properties between Cambridge Street and the High Street as a 5-storey Department Store, but only the first stage of this project was completed. No.5 Cambridge Street was demolished in September 1980 after V.H.Jarvis Ltd. closed. Mr. Bowness John Millburn was educated at St. John's School, the 'Latin' School, and Berkhamsted School, and was apprenticed to Messrs. Sarsons, ironmongers. He subsequently joined his father in the auction business, gradually taking over the heavier part of the work. In 1909 he married Miss Lily Mabel White, of Bierton. Their first child, Cecily Barbara, was born in 1915. About 1914 Mr. J.Millburn purchased the 'Church House' at Thame, Oxon, a building with a timber and asbestos structure and a corrugated iron roof, and had it moved to the garden of his house on Bierton Hill. The purpose of acquiring it was partly to provide a workshop for furniture repairs, and partly to store furniture and effects for the firm and for customers. In 1917 Mr. B.J.Millburn was conscripted into the Ox. & Bucks. Light Infantry. A letter written by Mr. J.Millburn to his son's C.O., asking for leave to be granted so that he (J.M.) could take his annual holiday, has survived. (The request was granted.) Mr. B.J.Millburn was later transferred to the Motor Transport branch of the Army Service Corps as a fitter, and served in Mesopotamia from January 1918 to March 1919, returning to Aylesbury in July. During this period his wife acted as clerk at the fortnightly sales. About 1930 Mr. J. Millburn purchased three cottages in Silver Lane (Nos. 1, 2 & 3). The interior walls of Nos. 1 & 2 were removed to convert the building into a warehouse. No.3 was demolished about 1935. The Silver Lane warehouse was used partly for storage (it was let to V.Robinson for a time), and partly for sales of very 'rough' articles which would have spoilt the appearance of the sales at 5 Cambridge Street. In the 1920s and 1930s a substantial part of the firm's business depended on Mr. B.J.Millburn visiting London auction sales (mainly Messrs. Tooth & Tooth), buying goods in bulk there, and transporting them to Aylesbury by motor lorry for re-sale. In this connection the 'Depository' at Bierton Hill was used as a temporary store-room, where goods bought in London could be sorted, repaired if necessary, and gradually fed into the auction room to make up suitable sales. (It was not good business to have too many of a particular type of article - pianos, say - in one sale, so they would be temporarily stored and released to the auction room as required.) From about 1920 onwards, all the sales were conducted by Mr. B.J.Millburn, with his father acting as clerk. This arrangement continued up to a week before the latter's death in June 1934 at the age of 89. Following Mr. J.Millburn's death, Miss Cecily Barbara Millburn (then aged 19) joined her father as clerk. There were no other full-time employees, but two or more part-time porters were employed on sale days and at other times as required. Small loads of furniture within the town were fetched and delivered by one of the porters on a hand-truck, but most entries for the sales were delivered by carriers or by the vendors themselves. The firm never had its own motor transport for goods, but from about 1922 Mr. B.J. Millburn owned a car which he used to visit potential customers; a proportion of the expenses of the car were charged to the firm. A telephone (Aylesbury 147) was installed in the early 1930s, with a battery-operated extension to his private house at No.62 Bierton Hill. After his father's death, Mr. B.J.Millburn moved to the latter's house (No.58), primarily because of the Depository in the garden. The firm did not use a typewriter until the late 1930s. The business continued much as before up to the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. The war had three major effects: (1) The bombing in London soon made it impracticable to continue buying goods there for re-sale in Aylesbury. (2) The shortage of new goods produced a boom in the second-hand trade, which more than made up for the loss of income from re-selling London goods. (3) There was an enormous increase in the amount of paper-work involved, due to the introduction of wartime regulations. Prior to the war, there had been hardly any restrictions on what could be sold by auction (an exception was guns: shotguns could be sold, but not rifles), but in 1942 severe limitations were placed on auction sales which almost brought the firm to a close. All vendors were required to sign a declaration, witnessed by a J.P., that (inter alia) they had not previously sold anything by auction within the preceeding six months. This regulation had little effect on other firms which held only occasional sales, mainly of contents of houses on the premises, but it was disastrous for firms such as J.Millburn & Son which depended on a quick turnover from a large number of vendors. Moreover, many of the firm's regular customers were in the habit of buying and selling at almost every sale, which now became illegal. The requirement for a J.P. to witness the declaration was subsequently waived (much to the relief of local J.P.s), but the six-month rule remained in force throughout the war and gave rise to much friction with potential sellers who did not understand it. Another complication was that the Maximum Prices Orders for the sale of second-hand goods applied as much to auctions as to retailers, with the result that for every sale a number of calculations had to made, based on formulae such as the number of drawer-handles on a piece of furniture, to determine the maximum bid that could be accepted for each article to which the regulations applied. If more than one customer was prepared to offer that sum, lots had to be drawn to decide who should have it. (For this purpose, Mr. Millburn used to keep an old hat and a set of numbers in his rostrum.) Another wartime requirement was that all auctioneers had to be members of a recognised professional institution. Neither Mr. B.J.Millburn nor his father had been in favour of trade association of any sort, but in 1942 he was obliged to join the Incorporated Society of Auctioneers & Landed Property Agents (A.L.P.A.). He was admitted as a Fellow on the strength of his age and lifetime's experience in the business (he was then aged 63). The extra burden imposed by the wartime regulations had a severe effect on Mr. Millburn's health, and in the immediate post-war years the business began to run down. In March 1950 he had the first of a series of heart attacks. His daughter Miss C.B. Millburn kept the business going for a few months with the aid of the part-time porters, engaging Mr. L.H.Dix of W.Brown & Co. to conduct the sales, but when it became evident that Mr. B.J.Millburn would not recover, preparations were made for the disposal of the business. At that time, Messrs. Percy Black & Co. and Messrs. W.Brown & Co. held occasional sales of furniture and effects, but not on a regular basis. Neither firm had any need to purchase the 'goodwill' of J.Millburn & Son, however, as there was nothing to stop them launching their own regular sales. Indeed, that is precisely what happened: as J.Millburn & Son's business ran down, both firms started holding regular auction sales of household furniture and effects, in competition with each other. W.Brown & Co. soon dropped out, and their auction room in Church Street (formerly part of Temple School) was demolished and the site redeveloped as 'Lincoln House'. Percy Black & Co. carried on for many years, but their auction sales formed only a small part of their business. The premises at 5 Cambridge Street, though ideally situated in the middle of the town in the 1880s, were almost impossible to run in the increasingly congested conditions of the post-war years. There were frequent complaints from adjacent shopkeepers of furniture vans blocking their windows, and on sale days it was always necessary to have police on duty to direct the traffic, Cambridge Street being still two-way then. There was, therefore, virtually no prospect of selling the premises as auction rooms. Instead, the premises were sold as a whole to V.H.Jarvis Ltd., who were still occupying the rooms over the auction room itself. The Depository at Bierton Road was cleared of stored furniture (some of which had been there for several decades) and down-rated from a commercial building to a garden shed. Nos. 1 & 2 Silver Lane (and the site of No.3) were sold to Mr. West, the photographer. Mr. B.J.Millburn died in October 1950 aged 71; Miss C.B.Millburn died in 1975 aged 60. John R.

Hattersley and Sons Ltd. were deposited in the Bradford District Archives in 1983, following the liquidation of the firm. They cover the whole period of the firm's machine-making activities from its foundation in 1789, beginning with the production of screws and small parts for textile machines; developing from c. 1835 the manufacture and export of power looms; later adding such subsiduary products as tobacco machines and garden furniture, The firm was also involved in textile manufacture, which is part covered by these records; however, between c.1850 and c.1890 the weaving business was conducted separately by Mr. Edwin Hattersley in Haworth and Keighley. The surviving records for this concern are deposited in the Brotherton Library, Leeds. Although the records in this catalogue relate primarily to loom-making, there is also a significant quantity of material relating to the personal finances and outside business concerns of various members of the Hattersley family and their successors, the Smiths. There are some records for related companies, whether subsiduaries or firms taken over by G. Hattersley and Sons Ltd.\nArrangement: When transferred to Bradford Archives the records preserved little of their working order; they have therefore been arranged under general headings given in the summary overleaf. Where possible, material has been kept in or returned to its original context - continuous series of volumes and other records in series or stored in bundles. The overall scheme, however, and the grouping of much of the material is artificial and not necessarily a reflection of administrative practice. N.B. There are some instances of accumulations of miscellaneous but important records which have not been dispersed and 'restored' to context or fully intergrated within the classification scheme:",

Located in Springwell Lane, Balby, it was built in 1897 to designs by J H Morton of South Shields to replace the original workhouse built by the Board of Poor Law Guardians on Cherry Tree Lane, Hexthorpe. (The redundant buildings were sold to the Great Northern Railway Locomotive Engineering Works - the 'Plant' - to extend their premises. A copy of the sale catalogue can be found amongst the archives of J Dawson and Sons, Doncaster Archives reference DY/DAW/9/103. It includes a plan if the site but not a photograph.) The new workhouse comprised a 'main building' (the workhouse) cottage homes for elderly married couples, an infirmary and building containing 'lunacy wards'. Twelve plans for the new workhouse, dated 1896, are to be found at Doncaster Archives reference DZ/P/110. Like all workhouses, it was renamed as a Poor Law Institution, by virtue of the Poor Law Institutions Order, 1913 issued by the Local Government Board. On the abolition of Poor Law Guardians from 1 April 1930, (under the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1929), responsibility for the Institution, known as Springwell House, passed to the Doncaster County Borough Council. The Public Assistance Committee of the county borough council had oversight of the administration of services inherited from the Guardians. These minute books are held by Doncaster Archives. In 1945, the Hospital Survey of the Sheffield and East Midland Area published by the Ministry of Health made the following comments on the Springwell House Public Assistance Institution: The Doncaster Public Assistance Institution, Springwell House, has not been appropriated because of the poor quality of the accommodation. The accommodation, in two main blocks and a maternity block, is nominally for 146 patients. The work is at least three fifths chronic, although there are a resident medical officer and a visiting surgeon. Acute medical and surgical cases are mixed in the wards. The surgeon visits thrice weekly and other consultants including an obstetrician may be called although rarely a physician. The wards are poor and cannot be made into good hospital accommodation; yet 1,069 admissions were recorded in 1938 and a average stay of only 28 days. The statistical table in the survey show that there were 146 beds in all, comprising 57 'Interchangeable General Beds', 6 for child medical and surgical cases, 4 for maternity cases, 12 for tuberculosis, 6 for venereal cases, 4 isolation and septic beds, and 57 for the chronic sick. (This report is amongst the archives of Doncaster Royal Infirmary, Doncaster Archives reference HR2/4/45, pages 25 and 128.) However, despite the statement made in the Survey of 1945, the premises were taken over by the National Health Service and were designated as the Western Hospital in 1950. (In addition to Springwell House, Doncaster county borough also provided a municipal maternity home at Hamilton Lodge, Carr House Road. The Hospital Survey of 1945 showed this as having fourteen beds (page 128) and wrote of both Doncaster's and Barnsley's 'small homes in converted premises, formerly private houses.They are in unsuitable premises' (page 25). A medical register of births 1950-1953 from Hamilton Lodge is to be found at HR3/10/1 below.) The archives of the Doncaster Poor Law Union have not been preserved, and so the principal source of information about the workhouse, apart from that which may be found in local newspapers and other unofficial sources, is to be found in the records of Doncaster poor law union workhouse, which form part of these surviving archives of the Western Hospital. The most significant of the surviving records of the workhouse are the registers of births (section 2 below) and deaths (section 3 below), both beginning in 1893, and the registers of religious creed (which begin in 1904, see section 4 below). The latter are essentially a register of all those who entered the workhouse. These continue as registers of the Doncaster borough public assistance institution.",

        "Description": "BUSINESS (INCLUDING SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES) + PERSONAL RECORDS; THREE DIMENSIONAL OBJECTS AND AUDIO RECORDINGS.\nAdministrative history: Thomas Beecham 1820-1907 Thomas Beecham was born on 3rd. December 1820 into a poor family who lived in the rural village of Curbridge near Whitney in Oxfordshire. Although his parents sent him to school at the age of six, further additions to the family meant he had to leave them when he was only eight and start to earn a living; a situation not uncommon in the rest of the country at this period. One of the many jobs he undertook was that of tending sheep which was a poorly paid and lonely job. Treatment of children in those days was harsh. They were left exposed to the elements and often went hungry. The life of the average labourer was gruelling. Excessive punishment could be expected for the least offence, with deportation and even hanging for poaching or similar misdemeanors. Doctors were beyond the 'purse' of most working-class people who thus had to rely on herbs and salves. In these, Thomas's mother, Sarah, had considerable knowledge and skill. Shepherding moulded Thomas's nature and he began to use his knowledge of herbs in treating animals. By his mid-teens he had established quite a reputation in Cropredy as a herbalist who could treat all kinds of ailments. In 1840 Thomas left Cropredy and went to stay with his Uncle William in Kidlington near Woodstock in Oxfordshire. By this time he had developed his pill formulae but supplemented his income with casual work as a postman and a jobbing gardener. Eventually he became an itinerant peddler carrying his pills and cures in a pack from village to village and selling them at the local markets. In 1847 Thomas moved north, first to Liverpool where he married Jane Evans, a Welsh woman some eight years his senior. The ceremony took place at Liverpool Parish Church on 26th May 1847 and they set up home in Wigan. The address on the Medical Licence stamped 1st. September 1847 is Wallgate and was, perhaps, the first indication of Thomas's intention to expand his business, for although a licence was not required when peddling pills by pack, it was essential for packaging articles and laying claim to a unique recipe. At this time Thomas was producing four products - Herbal Pills, Female's Friend, Royal Toothpowder and Golden Tooth Tincture. He was a born salesman and could be seen dispensing his pills whilst wearing a shepherd's smock and standing under a vast umbrella. In 1857 Thomas opened shop premises in Wigan which enabled him to carry on a mail-order service and obviated the need for peddling. It was here that tragedy struck. Jane Beecham, his wife, was illiterate and one Saturday a young girl named Elizabeth Smith entered the shop and requested a pennysworth of laudanum. Jane, who served her, omitted to remove the previous label from the bottle or to mark it appropriately. 14 weeks later the girl's brother accidentally overdosed with the laudanum and died. Although a verdict of accidental death was returned, the public of Wigan were not so ready to forgive. Thus it was that in 1860 the Beechams moved to Milk Street, St. Helens. Here Thomas concentrated exclusively on the sale of his pills. His mail-order service was expanding but once again he had to rely on market trade. Thomas's herbal products were first advertized in the St. Helens Intelligencer, 6th August 1859 and it was around that tiem the famous phrase 'worth a guinea a box' was born. Attributed to Mrs. Ellen Butler 'a lady of good family and business aptitude' it is claimed she would enthusiastically repeat the phrase to anyone who would listen. Whatever its origin it became the slogan of the company and before the turn of the century Thomas was the largest advertizer in the United Kingdom. By 1863 Thomas and Jane had parted and gone their separate ways. Business continued to flourish and Thomas moved to Westfield Streets, St. Helens. In 1864 he enrolled as a member of the United Society of Chemists and Druggists and around this time Thomas dropped his 'Doctor' title, although the use of Doctor on a marketed product was not officially forbidden until 1944. When Thomas's son Joseph finished his schooling at fifteen he joined in the business although he had already been Thomas's right hand for several years. Business was now booming; in 1865 the gross takings were \u00a32,532. 19s. 5d. and by 1867 they had almost doubled to \u00a34,556.0s.10d, With customers as far afield as York, Exeter and Dumfries. Thomas worked a fourteen hour day and every transaction was meticulously entered into the 'green order book'. In 1872 Jane died and the following year Thomas now fifty-two married Sarah Pemberton aged twenty-nine. By now the business had expanded so much it became necessary to employ full-time staff. Two of the first to be employed were William Moss, a teenage boy engaged as a packer and an eleven-year-old boy Tom Oldham. These two remained with Beechams for many years, Moss eventually becoming Works Manager whilst Tom Oldham became personal groom to the family. In 1876 Thomas acquired more property in Westfield Street where he started to erect his first factory. He moved to a new home, Hill House on Croppers Hill, in the summer of 1877 with his son, William, Joseph by now being married. His wife, Sarah had died the previous May and in September 1879 Thomas married for the third time, after a whirlwind courtship, to a Mrs. Mary Sawell, but unfortunately the union seemed doomed to failure almost from the start. By summer of 1881 the Beechams were installed in Mursley Hall, Buckinghamshire, and for a while Thomas left the factory in favour of the country life. However, soon he returned north and his prolonged absences from home did little to improve the deteriorating relationship between himself and Mary. The Beecham fortunes continued to soar over the next decade. Some indication of the commercial enterprise in St. Helens can be judged by the fact that four hundredweight of pills were being turned out daily. By 1884 nineteen staff were employed which, by August, had swollen to fifty-seven. The new factory built in Westfield Street, St. Helens and costing \u00a330,000 was the last word in efficiency and elegance. Originally surmounted by a clock tower which had three dials, a fourth was added especially for the Grrenbank area where the poorer people resided. Thomas had come a long way since the simply constructed pill counting machine he had devised in the early days. This had now been replaced by a machine operated by a water motor and capable of counting and filling three thousand boxes of pills a day. In 1889 Thomas gave Joseph a half share in the business although to all intents and purposes Joseph had been in control for the past ten years. Joseph was a great believer in advertizing, using many different avenues to bring Beechams Pills to public attention and had even begun to court the overseas market. Rumour has it that a generous donation of hymn books given by Beechams to an impecunious parish in South Shields was found to have in its Christmas section :- Hark. The herald angels sing Beechams pills are just the thing For easing pain and mothers mild Two for adults one for a child Thomas hotly denied the story, but correct or otherwise, peddlers were nevertheless hired to hum the tune up and down the country whilst children chanted it through the streets of St. Helens. Another illustration of Beecham ingenuity was a slim booklet entitled 'Beechams Help to Scholars' written in 1899. Dispatched on request to schoolmasters, it soon became a standard work and was especially useful to poor children. Information was comprehensive and included geographical definitions, foreign words and phrases, and an international table of automatic weights of the chemical elements. By the first year four million had been sent out and by 1927, thirty-seven million. By 1959 some forty-seven and a quarter million had been distributed. Almost as popular were Beecham's views which were photo-folios containing twenty-four scenes of various towns or regions. Beechams oracles were particularly ingenious. Appearing as plain pieces of paper, they when ignited, revealed a famous face such as the Prince of Wales or the Marquis of Salisbury. Equally as popular were Beechams Music Folios; twenty volumes of piano music which were especially appealing in the days when home entertainment centred around the family piano. The business continued to expand both at home and abroad and the factory in Westfield Street was extended in 1934 and again in 1948 and 1956. The Beechams were good and fair employers who demanded one hundred percent loyalty and obedience from their employees. In return they provided sick pay for their workers and treated them to day trips. Also available for recreational hours was a billiards room where free tea and biscuits were served. In 1895 Thomas retired to his final home, 'Wychwood', which he built in Norwood Avenue, Southport. He styled himself as a 'Lancashire Gentleman' - a compliment to his adopted county. During his lifetime he had lived to see four monarchs reign and many changes for the good - particularly the laws which stopped the exploitation of children inthe workplace. Thomas died on 6th April 1907 of pulmonary congestion, at the age of eighty-six, and was buried at the Borough Cemetery in St. Helens\nArrangement: CONTENTS BP/1 BUSINESS SECTION BP/1/1 Miscellaneous historical items BP/1/2 Products and ingredients BP/1/3 Legal documentation BP/1/4 Financial documentation BP/1/5 Personnel BP/1/6 Advertising (Examples of advertisements) BP/1/7 Anacona Motor Company BP/1/7/2 Beechams Pills Co.

        "Description": "INTRODUCTION This is the forty sixth volume of Additional Manuscripts (Add Mss) to have been catalogued in the West Sussex Record office and it has been compiled, in general, along the lines indicated in the introduction to the first volume in November 1956 The class of Additional Manuscripts embraces all the smaller gifts and deposits of documents received by the West Sussex Record Office, as distinct from the large family and estate collections, such as Goodwood MSS.; or accumulations from solicitors' offices, such as Oglethorpe and Anderson Mss.; collections of official bodies, such as Quarter Sessions records; or collections from other bodies, such as the records of the Royal Sussex Regiment, each of which is referred to and quoted by name. The majority of Additional Manuscripts have been deeds of title, though increasingly a healthy balance of a vast range of other original material has been catalogued in these volumes. However the pressure of the sheer weight of material to be catalogued has meant that since volume 29 in March 1983, the catalogues of title deeds, instead of being the detailed calendars that had been prepared until that date, have mainly been summary lists, with the emphasis being placed on the property concerned in the transaction, rather than on the parties involved, or the technicalities of the type of legal conveyance being used. From the thirty sixth volume in November 1987, the accession number of each collection catalogued is given at the head of each separate catalogue The documents listed in this catalogue range in date from a title deed of property in Ifield, 1565 (Add Mss 49935), to some records of Chichester Winemaking circle in 1996 (Add Mss 49775). As well as the usual deeds of title, the core of this catalogue is composed of records of Women's Institutes (Add Mss 49033-49352, 49392-49485, 49487-49582 and 49596-49649).

Personal papers include the plays and writings of Robert G. Newton (Add Mss 9,353-49391); letters and papers of the Hack family of Chichester, 1684-1924 (Add Mss 49665-49766) now a separate catalogue, 'Hack family of Chichester' within the from Landlord to Labourer project and the script of a radio broadcast by S.P.B.

Topics and people covered in the letters include Charles Masterman's political career and political events, 1907-1927; Charles and Lucy Masterman's literary work; family matters, particularly the Masterman children and family finances; Masterman and Lyttelton relatives; political and literary friends. All aspects of Masterman's life and career are represented in the collection from his school days at Weymouth College to his early death in 1927, particularly his work as an MP and government minister (1906-15) and his writings and journalism. The material includes memoirs written by his mother and other members of the Masterman family; volumes of letters from school friends; school and university notebooks; letters to his wife Lucy before and after their marriage (some written during House of Commons debates); a diary written in 1901, when he was living in Camberwell; correspondence with politicians (Herbert Asquith, David Lloyd George, Winston Churchill, Sir Edward Grey, W H Beveridge, Herbert Samuel, Augustine Birrell to name but a few) and writers, including John Buchan, Arnold Bennett, H G Wells and Ford Madox Ford; printed and typescript papers - many annotated by Masterman - relating to the work of government departments (including the Home Office, the National Health Insurance Commission, the Cabinet, and Wellington House) and to the work of the Liberal Party (including the Liberal Land Enquiry and the Liberal Industrial Enquiry); and notes for political speeches. The collection also includes manuscripts, typescripts, proofs and printed copies of some of Masterman's books and many of his periodicals and newspaper contributions. Included in the archive are letters which Lucy wrote to her husband between 1907-1927; letters to her parents and sisters; correspondence concerning the fate of individual refugees in Britain, 1939-1945; copies of the diaries, which she kept between 1908-1913, when Charles was a member of Asquith's governments, as well as other memoirs; manuscript, typescripts, proofs and printed copies of her poems, articles and book reviews; background material and drafts of her biography of Charles Masterman; also drafts of a number of other unpublished literary works.\nAdministrative history: Masterman, Charles Frederick Gurney (1874-1927), politician, author and journalist. Charles Masterman (1873-1927) was a Liberal politician who served as a Member of Parliament from 1906 to 1914 and again from 1923 to 1924. He held a series of government posts between 1908 and 1915 and played an important part in the preparation and implementation of the National Insurance Act of 1911 and in the organisation of British government propaganda during World War I. He was a prolific writer, publishing a number of books and contributing articles and reviews to newspapers and periodicals of the time. Lucy Masterman, Charles's wife, (1884-1977), was the daughter of General Sir Neville Lyttelton and Lady Katherine (n\u00e9e Stuart-Wortley). Before her marriage, Lucy had already earned a reputation as a poet. During her lifetime she published several volumes of verse, as well as contributing poetry, reviews and historical articles to newspapers and magazines over a period of 60 years. Her major literary work was her biography of Charles Masterman, published in 1939. After the death of her husband, Lucy continued to lead an energetic political life. She fought the Salisbury seat for the Liberal party unsuccessfully in the 1929 and 1931 General Elections and maintained an active correspondence with Liberal politicians until the 1970s. She had many interests, particularly the role of women, the plight of World War II refugees and prison reform.\nArrangement: The archive has been arranged into 70 sections: CFGM/1: FAMILY LETTERS CFGM/2: CHARLES MASTERMAN - LETTERS, SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY AND EARLY LIFE TO 1908.

        "Title": "Additional Manuscripts, catalogue 47",
        "Description": "This is the forty seventh volume of Additional Manuscripts (Add Mss) to have been catalogued in the West Sussex Record office and it has been compiled, in general, along the lines indicated in the introduction to the first volume in November 1956 The class of Additional Manuscripts embraces all the smaller gifts and deposits of documents received by the West Sussex Record Office, as distinct from the large family and estate collections, such as Goodwood MSS.; or accumulations from solicitors' offices, such as Oglethorpe and Anderson Mss.; collections of official bodies, such as Quarter Sessions records; or collections from other bodies, such as the records of the Royal Sussex Regiment, each of which is referred to and quoted by name. The majority of Additional Manuscripts have been deeds of title, though increasingly a healthy balance of a vast range of other original material has been catalogued in these volumes. However the pressure of the sheer weight of material to be catalogued has meant that since volume 29 in March 1983, the catalogues of title deeds, instead of being the detailed calendars that had been prepared until that date, have mainly been summary lists, with the emphasis being placed on the property concerned in the transaction, rather than on the parties involved, or the technicalities of the type of legal conveyance being used. From the thirty sixth volume in November 1987, the accession number of each collection catalogued is given at the head of each separate catalogue The documents listed in this catalogue range in date from a deed of property in Henfield, 1578 (Add MSS 51081) to an invitation to the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, 1997 (Add MSS 50003). As well as the usual deeds of title, there are manorial records, such as those for the manors of Warnham, Den in Warnham and Clympsfold, 16854-1920 (Add MSS 51181 and 51182), and Nytimber, 1857-1919 (Add MSS 51189); and maps, including those for Park Field in Findon, 1786 (Add MSS 50001) and Offington in Broadwater and West Tarring, 1790 (Add MSS 50002). Records of organisations include those of Chichester Festival Theatre Society, 1988-1997 (Add MSS 50031-50039); and West Sussex County Federation of Village Produce Associations, 1946-1997 (Add MSS 51158-51169). However, the largest part of the catalogue is devoted to the list of the plans prepared by Messrs. Tregear and Sons of buildings in the Bognor area between 1902 and 1985 (Add MSS 50075-51024) No index has been provided for this volume, as all the relevant details of this and all previous volumes have been included in the card indexes of persons, places, manors and subjects, which are to be found in the Search Room of the West Sussex Record Office Searchers are again asked to exercise care in quoting references, and to use the form Add Mss followed by the relevant number or numbers.

Sir John was the son of Sir John Ernle (c.1618-1697) of Whetham, Wiltshire, who was a Privy Councillor and served as Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1676 and 1689. The two children of the marriage were Hester (1676-1723), who married William Washbourne of Wichenford, Worcestershire, and John Kyrle Ernle (1682-1725), who married Constantia Rolt (c.1687-1755). John Kyrle Ernle's only surviving child, Constantia (c.1717?-1753) married Thomas, Viscount Dupplin, later Lord Kinnoull (1710-1787). When Lady Dupplin died in 1753, leaving no issue, she settled her estates upon James Money, son of her first cousin, Elizabeth (nee Washbourne), who had married Francis Money of Wellingborough, Northamptonshire. A long lawsuit followed between Lord Kinnoull and his late wife's heirs. James Money (1724-1785) inherited the Ernle and Kyrle estates of Whetham (Calne) and Homme House (Much Marcle) from his cousin Lady Dupplin in 1753. He also had property at Pitsford, Northamptonshire, and leased lands at Churcham in Gloucestershire. He pursued a military career, being a major in the 86th regiment on the island of Goree (Senegal) in 1760, a captain in Colonel Boscawen's regiment of foot in 1764, and finally a lieutenant-colonel. He married Eugenia Stoughton and their only surviving son was William Money. William Money (1748-1808) married Mary Webster and they shared a happy and affectionate family life with their six sons and seven daughters, all but two of whom survived to adulthood. He appears to have taken a keen interest in the management of his estates, and many documents in the collection are endorsed in his characteristic handwriting. On his death, his son William described his life as having been 'a long course of unequalled worth'. His eldest son James Money (1775-1843), who ended his life as Major-General Sir James Kyrle Money, succeeded to his father's estates in 1808. Like his grandfather, he chose a military career, rising from ensign (1793) to major (1804), lieutenant-colonel (1811), colonel (1825) and major-general (1838). He gave his brother William the life tenancy of the Whetham estate and assumed by royal warrant the additional surname and arms of Kyrle in 1809. His marriage to Ann Caroline Taylor was childless and when he died in 1843 the baronetcy became extinct and his estates descended to his next brother, William. William Money (1776-1848), who ended his life as Rev. William Money-Kyrle, succeeded to his brother's estates in 1843. He assumed by royal licence the name of Kyrle in 1844. Ordained as deacon in 1799 and priest in 1801, he was rector of Yatesbury, Wiltshire, from 1801 to 1843. By his wife Emma Down he had one daughter and seven sons, four of whom are well represented in this collection, i.e. William, Edward Kyrle, John Ernle and James Stoughton. Edward Kyrle Money ('Kyrle') (1810-1841) was a lieutenant in the 2nd regiment of the Bombay Light Infantry. James Stoughton Money ('Stoughton') (1813-1852), who ended his life as James Stoughton Money-Kyrle, was interested in genealogy, archaeology and antiquities, and was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In his early years, until 1835, he worked for the East India Company. Ordained as deacon in 1841 and priest in 1842, he succeeded his father as rector of Yatesbury in 1843. He seems to have had constant financial problems and he died young. William Money (1808-1868), later called William Money-Kyrle, was his father's eldest son and heir. For a short time he appears to have practiced as a barrister of the Inner Temple. Despite suffering from ill-health, and possibly hypochondria, he travelled widely, touring Europe and the Holy Land in the mid-1840s. He was High Sheriff of Herefordshire in 1853. A bachelor, he was succeeded by his next surviving brother. John Ernle ('Ernle') Money (1812-1894), later called John Ernle Money-Kyrle, succeeded his brother in 1868. He married firstly Harriet Louisa Sutton (d.1857) and secondly Ada Frances Simons (d.1918) and had children by both wives. He served in the 32nd regiment of foot (ensign 1833, captain 1843) and ended his military career as lieutenant-colonel. Like his brother William, he served in the Herefordshire Militia and as Deputy Lieutenant for Herefordshire. Audley Walter Washbourne Money-Kyrle (1846-1908) succeeded to the family estates, as eldest surviving son, in 1894. He married Florence Cecilia Smith-Bosanquet (1860-1930) and left a son and two daughters. He was in India in the army (ensign 1866, lieutenant 1871), and attained the rank of major, after having served in the 55th and 19th regiments. Like his father and uncle he was Deputy Lieutenant for Herefordshire. His son Roger was only ten years old when Audley died. Roger Ernle Money-Kyrle (1898-1980) served with the Royal Flying Corps during the Great War. He sold the Homme House estate at Much Marcle to his uncle, Rev. Cecil Leigh Money-Kyrle, in 1922. He worked for a PhD at Vienna University, where he met Sigmund Freud, and was one of the last Englishmen to be psychoanalysed by Freud himself. He set up as an analyst in London in 1950. He married Helen Juliet Rachel ('Minora') Fox and was survived by his four sons. Ernle (1923-1999), a civil engineer; Audley Francis (1925-1999), a photographer and natural historian; Roger Spencer (1928- ), a doctor; and John Middleton (1931- ), an architect.",

The 1932 Town and County Planning Act enlarged the scope of planning legislation to include county areas as well as urban land in course of development or likely to be built upon, and gave County Councils power to participate in the planning of their counties. Such a Joint Planning Committee was set-up in Northumberland in 1939. However it was not until July 1948 that the County Council became the local planning authority for the whole county by virtue of the Town and County Planning Act, 1947. The County Planning Committee delegated certain control development functions to County District Councils, such as Newburn. The building control functions of the district councils remained unaffected by the 1947 Act, however, there would appear to be numerous instances of duplication of planning applications; therefore plans relating to applications to build or alter properties, not involving large scale development, may be found in the building control registers and plans series. Plans of large scale development applications are preserved at the Northumberland Record Office, Melton Park, Newcastle, but copies are mostly available with the general plans series UD/Nb/65. (6 volumes)\nAdministrative history: The Local Government Board Confirming Order for the conversion of part of the large Northumberland Rural District of Castle Ward into Newburn Local Board, comprising East and West Denton, Lemington, Newburn, Sugley, Throckley, Walbottle and Westerhope was signed on 2 March 1893. The Urban District was created the following year. The Urban District Council was represented on Gosforth, Newburn and Castle Ward Joint Hospital Committee from 1903 to 1939 and from 1939 until 1948 on the West Northumberland Joint Hospital Board. The Council administered the Isolation Hospital at Lemington. Until 1929 Newburn UDC was part of Castle Ward Poor Law Union and as such oversaw the assessment and collection of the poor-rates for residents in the parishes of Newburn, East Denton, Lemington and Sugley. Between 1894 and 1974 Newburn UDC was responsible for approving planning applications within its area. In 1974 the Local Government Act merged Newburn with the City of Newcastle upon Tyne.",

It was known as South Gosforth Local Board. After the 1894 Local Government Act, it became South Gosforth U.D.C. The following year, by a Northumberland County Council order dated 14 March 1895, the title was changed again to Gosforth U.D.C. On 15 July 1903 the District Council applied to Northumberland County Council for an order to extend its boundaries to include the parishes of North Gosforth, East Brunton, West Brunton, Fawdon and the greater part of Kenton. An enquiry was held into the Gosforth Scheme on 9 September 1903, but the proposal was refused. By the County of Northumberland (Gosforth Wards) Order 1906, Gosforth was divided into four wards, namely Coxlodge, All Saints, St Nicholas and South Gosforth. In 1908 the parishes of Coxlodge and South Gosforth were amalgamated into the parish of Gosforth. Gosforth extended its boundaries, after the County of Northumberland Review Order 1935, to include part of Castle Ward Rural District. This comprised sections of East Brunton, Fawdon and North Gosforth civil parishes. Gosforth U.D.C. was finally abolished on 1 April 1974, to become part of Newcastle Metropolitan Borough Council.",

        "Title": "Papers of Charlotte Despard",
        "Description": "The archive consists of letters from Charlotte Despard to Charles Wilson (1920-1932) ; photograph of Mrs Wilson (c. 1920); and a diary of a trip to the USSR (1930). The letters cover the periods 1920-1922 and 1930-1932, and were written to Mr Charles Wilson of Willington, County Durham, Mr Wilson was a political activist who worked with the Durham miners, and Mrs Despard lectured to his students in 1921 and 1930. In the letters Mrs Despard refers to Mr Wilson's poetry; she also sent him a poem that she had written. She refers to her own political activities, in Ireland, lecturing for the Labour Party against British Policy in India. She also mentions several of the illnesses that were beginning to restrict severely such activities.\nAdministrative history: Charlotte Despard (1844-1939) was born in 1844, the daughter of Captain William French and Margaret Eccles. In the 1850s her father died and her mother became mentally ill, resulting in the child being sent to London to live with relatives. Her early experiences in London led her to become politically radical at a young age but she was not active until after her marriage in 1870 to Maximilian Despard a wealthy Anglo-Irish businessman (one of the founders of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank), who was, like her, a rich radical Liberal. Charlotte supported Home Rule for Ireland from 1880. In 1874 Despard published her first novel, 'Chaste as Ice, Pure as Snow' which would be followed by several more in rapid succession. Her husband died in 1890, and she emerged from the resultant depression through involvement in social work at the Nine Elms Mission in Battersea where she would eventually move the following year. From 1894-1903 she acted as a poor law guardian in Vauxhall, taking on more responsibility as a school manager in 1899. In this period her political views became more marked, supporting the Marxist Social Democratic Federation and eventually being nominated as one of their representatives at the second International in 1896. This association continued until 1906 when she became a member of the Independent Labour Party. For a short time she was involved in the Union of Practical Suffragists and then the Adult Suffrage Society that called for votes for women of all levels of society. However, these affiliations were later to go into abeyance when she became a leader of the militant suffragette movement alongside the Pankhursts. Her initial reaction to the Women's Social & Political Union (WSPU) was hostile due to their willingness to accept a socially limited franchise and in 1906 she spoke out against them at the first meeting of the Women's Labour League. It was the former Labour Party organiser Teresa Billington-Greig who finally convinced her to become a member and in the summer of 1906. After the resignation of Sylvia Pankhurst and the arrival of Emmeline and Christabel in London, Despard became the Joint Secretary of the WSPU with Edith How-Martyn, while also becoming active on a practical level. In Feb 1907 she was arrested during the demonstration from the 'Women's Parliament' held in Caxton Hall to the Houses of Parliament and was sentenced to three weeks in prison. However, in the Spring of 1907, rifts began to grow between Despard and the Pankhursts when it became clear that WSPU election policy meant that the group were effectively supporting Conservative candidates as a means of opposing Liberal candidates. Despard, How-Martyn, and Anne Cobden Sanderson jointly sent a message to the Independent Labour Party conference to state that they would not take part in any by-election where a Labour Party candidate was standing. This was immediately publicly repudiated by Emmeline Pankhurst. In Sep 1907, the WSPU's annual meeting was cancelled by the Pankhursts and the group's constitution changed without consultation of members. However, Despard and Billington-Greig together organised another conference for the intended day and effectively began the Women's Freedom Party that still took a militant approach but concentrated on non-violent illegal methods. The following year, she spent five months touring the country in a caravan. 1909 began with her being arrested for leading a delegation to speak to the Prime Minister, but was discharged after five days for ill health. The following month she was officially elected president of the Women's Freedom League. In 1911 she was one of those who organised resistance to the census which took place that year as well as becoming the editor of 'the Vote'. The sheer range of her activities caused some colleagues to question her focus as leader of the WFL and dissent began to grow, resulting in the resignation of Billington-Greig and attempts to oust her from the leadership of the organisation after the failure of the Conciliation Bill in 1912. In the event, it was the majority of the executive board that resigned and Despard remained in place and attended the Budapest Congress of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance the following year in this capacity. When war was declared in 1914 the Women's Freedom League rejected the pro-war stance of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies and the WSPU which both suspended their suffrage campaigns. Instead, in 1915, Despard joined the Women's International League, the National Council for Civil Liberties, the Women's Peace Crusade and the No Conscription Fellowship and in 1917 she resigned as President of WFL to concentrate on working for the Women's Peace Crusade. Also in 1917 she attended the convention of the British Socialists in Leeds in 1917 at which the Revolution in Russia was welcomed and where she was elected to the provisional committee of the Workers' Socialist Federation. After the Qualification of Women Act was introduced in 1918, Despard stood as the ultimately unsuccessful Labour candidate in Battersea in the post-war election, having resigned as the leader of the WFL. Despard had been interested in Irish politics from a campaigning visit to Dublin in 1909. She was strongly in favour of Home Rule, but after the death of the hunger-striker Terence Macswiney she committed most of her time and money to the cause of communism in Ireland. She moved to Ireland in 1920 and thereafter only visited London briefly each summer. She lived and worked with Maude Gonne in Dublin to create a reception centre for displaced people as well as campaigning against the British policy of internment. Despard formed the Women Prisoners' Defence League, which was later banned. Despard also paid for the establishment of a factory intended to give employment to Republicans who were economically discriminated against. In 1921 she moved to Roebuck House a mansion outside Dublin that would frequently be raided by the police looking for IRA members who found a safe house there. However, she later resigned from Sinn Fein as a response to the factionalism of its members. She visited the Soviet Union in 1930, and took the decision to move from Dublin to Northern Ireland in the wake of an attack on the Irish Workers' College, which she had financed for some time. In moving to Belfast she handed Roebuck House to Maude Gonne. In the mid-thirties, her finances were becoming strained and she was declared bankrupt in 1937. Nonetheless, she continued to fight Fascism until her death as a result of a fall at her home in Nov 1939.",

        "Description": "'I was delighted to get your postcard at Biarritz and to hear that you did not think one too mad for suddenly making up my mind to start for Spain in 3 days notice! I would not have left Auberon only I found that he had so much work, when he began his exam., that I saw nothing of him and I knew he would get through a lot of work if I came away. He insisted and Mother thought it a good plan. Ria [Auberon's sister] was very pleased to have me, so off I came [28 March]. Voila l'histoire Spain is not like Europe! and in consequence enormously interesting. Directly we arrived in Biarritz [29 March], we were photographed. Ria, [Lady Sysonby], Freda [Lady Blois - both Auberon's sisters], the maid and I. When the monstrous result arrived on Tuesday night, it was pasted on to our book of Kilometrigue tickets (an extraordinary cheap way of travelling in Spain) and off we started on Wednesday morning [3 April]. Burgos. Unfortunately we could not stop at Fontenabia on the way, but we saw it and the Ile des Faisans in the distance. At Irun, the Spanish frontier, we expected to find all civilization left behind, but except for the overpowering smell of that herb, garlic, it was most comfortable. The porters were unable to speak a word of anything except Spanish, but that was nothing to us, as we were all armed with conversation books, which we whipped out simultaneously. I must confess the mirth of the 'mozzos' (porters) was a little disconcerting. We got through the customs at Irun without opening our boxes, as Ria had a letter from a Spanish friend, the Duc d'Alva. The inn at Burgos far better than we thought - quite nice rooms, decent food and no fleas. The breakfast at a Spanish Inn is rather trying - consists of chocolate so thick that you can stand a spoon in it and strongly flavoured with cinamon! Burgos is most interesting and especially so, as few foreigners go there. We drove in the morning to the Cartuza de (Miraflous?) Monastry. The chief site there is the tomb which Isabella the Catholic put up to her Father and Mother. It is by Gil de Siloe and quite exquisite. There are also some beautiful things in the Sacristy. The Cathedra (Gothic) is wonderful, so absolutely different from anything one has ever seen! The only drawback to Burgos was the intense cold. We left on Thursday afternoon in a snow storm! When we arrived here at 12 that night, we did feel in clover. Sir Maurice and Lady de Bunsen are too kind and nice for words. They have only just got into the new Embassy and it is so delightfully comfortable and pretty and we are having such a good time. For besides the enormous interest of being in Madrid and feasting on the pictures, it is so delightful staying with the de Bunsens. Added to that also, Ria and I had an audience with Queen Ena this afternoon. She was so nice and evidently so pleased to see us. [Florence recorded in her diary on 13 April details of the Spanish trip which she had received from Auberon, who had them in 2 letters from Joan. 'Then Joan and Ria were summoned to an audience with the young Queen, who was very glad to see her play fellow, Joan'] There is great pertubation in the Court owing to King Edward's visit to Cartagena. This, of course, means that King Alfonso has to leave Madrid tomorrow night, and they are all terrified that the infant will arrive, while he is away. This would be the most awful affair in Spain, the baby is kept in the dark until the King has seen it and then it is presented to all the foreign ambassadors on a gold salva! The wretched ambassadors are summoned directly the Queen is taken ill and have to wait in a room close bye. The event is not due till the 20th, [the child a boy, was born on 10 May], but the Doctor and Nurse say it may happen any moment. Last night all the officers and soldiers were confined to barracks, as they thought it was going to arrive. The Queen was very amusing, but also very pathetic. She says she could bear anything, if only they would not fuss her so much! We were with her for more than half an hour, then the King came in and we left after being presented. The Queen said 'Alfonso is so worried, he cannot even eat!' We then went to see Princess Henry who is in an awful fuss. She came here to tea. Yesterday morning Sir Maurice drove us in his cart to the Picture Gallery and introduced us himself to the greatest treasures. The Velasquez room simply takes one's breath away. They are so splendid The Murillos are in a seperate room also. They of course always have such charm and are most beautiful, but we felt it was quite a pity to have seen them the same day as the Velasquez, as they are so different and not to be compared. We are keeping the Raphaels and the Titians for another day. We have just seen the wonderful 'Madonna del pesce'. How you would revel in the pictures. I suppose there is no chance of our meeting in Spain, as you have now decided with Mr. Hyett on Sicily? I must say travelling in Spain is not comfortable, but there are wonderful things to see. We leave here on Tuesday for Toledo and return here on Thursday for the day, leave that night for Cordova, arrive early in the morning, stay 2 hours and go on to Seville, where we stay about 4 or 5 days, then on to Grenada from there to Ronda and to Gibralter 23rd or 26th. We stay with General Forester Walker at Gib. I will enclose list of hotels so that I might possibly hear from you. Yesterday Lady de Bunsen took us to drive in the Kings Park, the Casa del Campo, where you get a glorious view of the mountains. We spent the rest of the afternoon poking about in pawn shops, but they could only talk Spanish, which was a drawback. An interesting dinner party here. Various Spanish grandees. They all talked French or English. Among them was the Duc d'Alva, a most attractive young man. He is going to take us in his motor to the Escurial tomorrow. This morning I trotted about Madrid with a most amiable Spaniard, Mr. de Torres. Among other things we went to the Armerie, which, of course, is the finest collection of armour in the world and enormously interesting. Tonight more Spaniards come to dine. We shall be sorry to leave on Tuesday! I have good news of Mother. I asked her if she would like Denys to [write?] to Auberon as she could so easily go. Will you please send this letter on to her, as I have no time now to write and tell..' [not completed] (103/228)",

        "Title": "Papers of Millicent Garrett Fawcett",
        "Description": "The archive consists of the personal papers of Millicent Garrett Fawcett; correspondence (related to suffrage; the Henry Cust case, the Northwest Durham by-election (1914) and on the status of women in India (1899-1918)); items relating to the Paris Women's Congress (1919) and Fawcett's Stansfeld lecture (1921-1902); papers relating to the creation of the Commission of Inquiry's report into South African Concentration Camps (1901-2), including Fawcett's personal diary of the visit and official report with photographs, pamphlets and tickets inserted; papers related to the role of Women in the Great War (including a large collection of press cuttings); personal memorabilia, including Philippa Fawcett's Irish holiday diary (1893) and albums and a bag owned by Millicent Garrett Fawcett; personal financial papers; a variety of working papers of Millicent Garrett Fawcett (1880-1929), including notes on speeches, volumes and articles she received or wrote herself.\nAdministrative history: Millicent Garrett Fawcett (1847-1929) was born in Suffolk in 1847, the daughter of Newson and Louisa Garrett and the sister of Samuel Garrett, Agnes Garrett, Louise Smith and Elizabeth Garrett Anderson. The sisters' early interest in the issue of women's suffrage and commitment to the Liberal party were heightened after attending a speech given in London by John Stuart Mill in July 1865. Though considered too young to sign the petition in favour of votes for women, which was presented to the House of Commons in 1866, Millicent attended the debate on the issue in May 1867. This occurred a month after she married the professor of political economy and radical Liberal MP for Brighton, Henry Fawcett. Throughout their marriage, the future cabinet minister supported his wife's activities while she acted as his secretary due to his blindness. Their only child, Philippa Fawcett, was born the following year and that same month Millicent Garrett Fawcett published her first article, on the education of women. In Jul 1867, Millicent Garrett Fawcett was asked to join the executive committee of the London National Society for Women's Suffrage and was one of the speakers at its first public meeting two years later. She continued her work with the London National Society until after the death of John Stuart Mill in 1874, when she left the organisation to work with the Central Committee for Women's Suffrage. This was a step which she had avoided taking when the latter was formed in 1871 due to its public identification with the campaign for the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. Fawcett, despite her support for the movement's actions, had initially believed that the suffrage movement might be damaged by identification with such controversial work. However, the two groups later merged in 1877 as the new Central Committee for Women's Suffrage and a new executive committee was formed which included Fawcett herself. Her influence helped guide the group towards support for moderate policies and methods. She did little public speaking during this period but after the death of her husband in 1884 and a subsequent period of depression, she was persuaded to become a touring speaker once more in 1886 and began to devote her time to the work of the women's suffrage movement. In addition to women's suffrage Millicent Garrett Fawcett also became involved in the newly created National Vigilance Association, established in 1885, alongside campaigners such as J Stansfeld MP, Mr WT Stead, Mrs Mitchell, and Josephine Butler. In 1894 Fawcett's interest in public morality led her to vigorously campaign against the candidature of Henry Cust as Conservative MP for North Manchester. Cust, who had been known to have had several affairs, had seduced a young woman. Despite marrying Cust's marriage in 1893, after pressure from Balfour, Fawcett felt Cust was unfit for public office. Fawcett's campaign persisted until Cust's resignation in 1895, with some suffrage supporters concerned by Fawcett's doggedness in what they felt was a divisive campaign. In the late nineteenth century, the women's suffrage movement was closely identified with the Liberal Party through its traditional support for their work and the affiliation of many workers such as Fawcett herself. However, the party was, at this time, split over the issue of Home Rule for Ireland. Fawcett herself left the party to become a Liberal Unionist and helped lead the Women's Liberal Unionist Association. When it was proposed that the Central Committee's constitution should be changed to allow political organisations, and principally the Women's Liberal Federation, to affiliate, Fawcett opposed this and became the Honorary Treasurer when the majority of members left to form the Central National Society for Women's Suffrage. However, in 1893 she became one of the leading members of the Special Appeal Committee that was formed to repair the divisions in the movement. On the 19 Oct 1896 she was asked to preside over the joint meetings of the suffrage societies, which resulted in the geographical division of the country and the formation of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. She was appointed as the honorary secretary of the Central and Eastern Society that year and became a member of the parliamentary committee of the NUWSS itself. It was not until the parent group's reorganisation in 1907 that she was elected president of the National Union, a position that she would retain until 1919. By 1901, she was already eminent enough to be one of the first women appointed to sit on a Commission of Inquiry into the concentration camps created for Boer civilians by the British during the Boer War. Despite this, her work for suffrage never slackened and she was one of the leaders of the Mud March held in Feb 1907 as well as of the NUWSS procession from Embankment to the Albert Hall in Jun 1908. She became one of the Fighting Fund Committee in 1912 and managed the aftermath of the introduction of the policy, in particular during the North West Durham by-election in 1914, when other members opposed a step that effectively meant supporting the Labour Party when an anti-suffrage Liberal candidate was standing in a constituency. When the First World War broke out in Aug 1914, Fawcett called for the suspension of the NUWSS' political work and a change in activities to facilitate war work. This stance led to divisions in the organisation. The majority of its officers and ten of the executive committee resigned when she vetoed their attendance of a Women's Peace Congress in the Hague in 1915. However, she retained her position in the group. During the war, she also found time to become involved in the issue of women's social, political and educational status in India, an area in which she had become interested through her husband and retained after the conflict came to an end. She remained at the head of the NUWSS when the women's suffrage clause was added to the Representation of the People Act in 1918 and attended the Women's Peace Conference in Paris before lobbying the governments assembled there for the Peace Conference in 1919. She retired in Mar 1919 when the NUWSS became the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship but remained on its executive committee. She also continued her activities as the vice-president of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, to which she had been elected in 1902, for another year. After this she became the Chair of the journal, the 'Women's Leader', and appointed a Dame of the British Empire in 1925. It was in that year that she resigned from both NUSEC and the newspaper's board after opposing the organisation's policy in support of family allowances. She remained active until the end of her life, undertaking a trip to the Far East with her sister Agnes only a short time before her death in 1929.\nArrangement: Arrangement imposed by archivist. weeded sorted and arranged May 2007.

        "Context Description": "",
        "Title": "The Druitt papers",
        "Description": "The Druitt papers, documents relating to a nineteenth century London physician and surgeon and his family The collection contains a great deal of material relating to Doctor Robert Druitt's professional and private interests. These include medicine, sanitation, public health, wine drinking and temperance and church music. There is also much correspondence between the doctor and his family and other nineteenth century figures. Also included are the papers of the doctor's father, wife and children and some Tupper Family papers. The value of these documents may be deduced from the fact that the professions of the doctor's children, who were reasonably good correspondents, included those of a parson, a solicitor, a doctor (who emigrated to Australia), a naval officer, a teacher and a musician. A very interesting feature of the collection is that a nephew of Dr. Robert Druitt - one Montague John Druitt, is the chief 'Jack the Ripper' suspect today. (Jack the Ripper, by Daniel Farson.) 'Jack the Ripper' was the man (or woman - 'Jill the Ripper'), who in 1888 murdered at least six prostitutes in the East End of London. There is a letter written by Montague to his uncle Robert amongst these papers. This reveals nothing sensational, but is an example of his handwriting, which up to now (his signature excepted) has not been found. 'The contrast between the be-wigged, cane adorned, and sometimes pompous medicus of former times, with the intelligent, self reliant unassuming physician of today is surely very remarkable.' [From Photographs of Eminent Medical Men, ed. by Wm. Tindal Robertson. London.] The documents listed in the medical section of Robert Druitt's part of the catalogue illustrate his career history in full. They include certificates, testimonials, letters and printed and miscellaneous material. Many of his lectures and other notes on sanitation and public health are contained in the collection. The papers include correspondence, notes and many printed works relating to wine and temperance. There is a large group of letters written to Doctor Druitt, the majority from his family. Other correspondents include W. Bright, Anthony Ashley Cooper, Edwin Chadwick, Randall T. Davidson, Benjamin Ferrey (his brother-in-law), Henry Fitzalan Howard, James R. Hope-Scott, R. Knox, David Livingstone, Caroline Norton (Melbourne's confidant) and Charles Mayo. The family correspondence is a very full group and well illustrates the life of a large middle class family in mid and late nineteenth century England. There are large numbers of condolence letters [Condolence letter writing appeared to be a popular Victorian pastime.] following the deaths of members of the family also over 200 letters written to her husband in Madras and more than 80 replies. Perhaps the most interesting group are those from her children beginning with their early education, moving on through Secondary and University education, then taking in their professions, marriages, holidays and many problems of which they tell their mother. Her eldest son Robert wrote 138 letters between 1866 and 1898, her second son Charles 353, between 1861 and 1898 and there are over 350 from the rest of her children. Her most prolific letter writing child Charles was ordained into the Church and all his struggles and successes in life, as well as much material on religious questions of the time - ritualism, the deceased wife's sister bill etc. - come through in his letters to her. Her third son Cuthbert, who was in the navy, wrote from all corners of the world describing his life in the navy and the places he saw. All the family holidayed in Europe too and corresponded with her from there. A letter written to her in 1873 by Chas. Willcox of Warnham contains a photograph of the tombstone of Benjamin Jesty on which is written the claim he discovered vaccination. The date is earlier than that of Jenner's discovery. Other letters in 1883 from William Druitt relate to Charles Lamb's supposed love for Mary Druitt illustrated by an epitaph on her tombstone in Wimborne. The other papers in her group include diaries, accounts and estate papers. She died in 1899 survived by three sons and three daughters. There is a small group of papers pertaining to Robert Druitt (6.1847) Much of Charles Druitt's career is illustrated by the few papers that survive, relating to him and also by the already mentioned vast correspondence to his mother. He wrote a number of hymns and small theological works and had published a series of letters between himself and Sir Thomas Grove, Bart., M.P. on 'the deceased wife's sister Bill'. Of the four sons Cuthbert Druitt's papers are the most extensive and perhaps the most interesting. All his certificates gained in the navy, as well as lists of clothing required, abstracts of ships passages and other papers survive, and a small group relating to his employment in South America also. There are few papers relating to Isabella Druitt (b 1852) A few papers survive relating to the career of Lionel Druitt (b. 1854) There is a large collection of general and family correspondence with Emily Druitt up to her death. Of particular importance is her correspondence with members of the armed forces serving in the First World War. There are letters from barracks in England, Egypt, Cape Town, the front line in France, a prisoner-of-war camp in Ebersdorf and an internment camp in Switzerland There survives a small number of letters relating to Katherine Druitt (b. 1858) The remaining papers in the collection pertain to Emily Ferrey [who married Benjamin Ferrey the architect and sister of Isabella Druitt], the Tuppers and a few nineteenth century notables. Deposited with the Druitt Papers was a small group relating to the Tupper family. The connection between the two families is two fold. First as mentioned previously Robert Druitt junior married Alice M. Tupper and secondly the Tuppers lived next door to the Druitts in Strathmore Gardens. The first group of letters relate to Martin Tupper, who was the Duke of Wellington's physician. Apart from this his chief claim to recognition was that he twice refused a baronetcy, first from Lord Liverpool and secondly from the Duke of Wellington. The largest series relate to Daniel Tupper, who was the Inspector of Accounts in the Lord Chamberlain's office. There are 45 letters written to his wife, most of which are loveletters before and after their marriage. The letters also include two from his brother Martin Farquhar Tupper a nineteenth century poet of great repute. He was popular in England, but this feeling was lukewarm compared to his popularity in America where he was considered as great as Shakespeare. Towards the end of his life and afterwards he fell very quickly from favour to be virtually unknown outside literary circles today. In Druitt 510 there is an early, possibly unpublished, poem by him. After Daniel Tupper's death his wife Mary Ellinor wrote to the Queen asking for a pension. The reply granted the pension, but pointed out that this was an unprecedented act.\nAdministrative history: This branch of the Druitt family lived mainly in London during the creation of the papers, although Wimborne Minster in Dorset was the home of their ancestors for more than two centuries and the birthplace of Doctor Druitt. Robert Druitt was born in December 1814, the eldest of four sons of Robert Druitt of Wimborne Minster. His family for more than a century before his birth had practised medicine in this small Dorset town. (Druitt Ms. 1, is a doctor's common place book dating from 1689, having been started by a member of the Druitt family in that year). On his mother's side he was related to the Mayo family of Winchester, a famous name in medical circles. It was not surprising therefore, when he chose medicine as his career. His education began at the Queen Elizabeth's Free Grammar School in Wimborne. At the age of sixteen he moved from there to Winchester hospital to begin his apprenticeship, as a pupil of Mr. Charles Mayo, surgeon. In 1834 he moved to the Middlesex Hospital and enrolled as a medical student at King's College. In 1836 he took the Licence of the Society of Apothecaries and in the following year became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, as well as taking up a surgeon's practice in Bruton Street, Berkley Square, with a Mr. Challice. He there began the work for which his name is most remembered in medicine, The Surgeon's Vade Mecum. The first edition appeared in 1839 and between then and 1878, eleven editions were produced, over 40,000 copies sold and it was reprinted in America and translated into many European languages. It became the standard work for every trainee surgeon for more than half a century. In 1845 he became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and in 1852 a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians. In the same year he went to Paris to study under the great French physician Pajot. Meanwhile in 1845 he had married Isabella Hopkinson at St. Pancras Church and shortly afterwards opened a new surgeon's practice at 39A, Curzon Street, Mayfair. He continued in practice there until 1858, when he started a physicians practice at 37 Hertford Street, Mayfair staying there until 1872, when he retired, through ill health (haematinuria). For his health's sake he was forced to winter abroad and for three winters 1873, 1874 and 1875 he went to Madras at the invitation of his friend Lord Hobart, the Governor there. In recognition of his services to medicine a large group of colleagues and friends, 370 in all gave him a cheque for \u00a31,215 in a silver cup. '. in evidence of their sympathy with him in a prolonged illness, induced by years of generous and unwearied labours in the cause of humanity.. Medical Times and Gazette, 26 May 1883 In 1875 he made his last move to Strathmore Gardens in Kensington, where he finally succumbed to his illness on the 15 May 1883. Other honours conferred on Dr. Druitt during his life include a Fellowship of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in 1853, honorary membership of the Society of Monte-regio (Italy) in 1856, a Fellowship of the Pathological Society of Montreal in 1856, honorary membership of the Society of Physico-Medica of Erlangen (Germany) in 1858 and in 1874 he was awarded the Lambeth degree of Doctor of Medicine Powers to grant medical degrees were reserved to the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Medical Act of 1857 abolished any qualification to practice with these degrees., receiving one of the last ever awarded. He was, with John Challice, the prime mover in founding the King's College Medical and Scientific Society in 1833 and was a fairly regular attendant at the Society's meetings, as well as one of the Vice Presidents. Doctor Druitt had many other interests in which he achieved more than local fame. He was particularly concerned with the sanitary and public health conditions existing in London and elsewhere. In 1856 he was elected Medical Officer of Health to St. George's Hanover Square and in 1864 made President of the Metropolitan Association of Medical Officers of health. His dedication is illustrated by his visit to Amiens during a Cholera epidemic in 1866, thus exposing himself to the illness in order to find out more about it. His findings were published in the Medical Times and Gazette in 1866. In the nineteenth century there was great controversy over the question of the drinking of alcohol. Dr. Druitt was inevitably involved in the great moral struggle that took place under the banner of temperance. His opinion was that wine taken in moderation was of immense value to the health of man. His Report on the Cheap Wines of various countries, published in 1865 became one of his more popular works. Gladstone, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, seemed to be of the same opinion, by lifting the duty on wine he made it much cheaper to buy. Outside the medical side of his life Robert Druitt was involved in literary and cultural pursuits. He never allowed to rust his ease and fluency with the Classics and his many works illustrate his interest in literary matter, which included the editorship of the Medical Times and Gazette for ten years, 1862-1872, and his contribution to it of many 'Letters From Madras' in 1873 and 1874. He was a deeply religious man and his great passion was for Church Music. With three London incumbents he founded the Society for Promoting Church music in 1845 and assisted in editing its monthly periodical The Parish Choir. The society's first minute book is contained in the collection. He also prepared several other pamphlets on Church music. His other interests included botany, chemistry, geology, languages and the scriptures. Isabella Druitt (1823-1899), the wife of Robert, was the second daughter of William and Elizabeth Hopkinson. She was both a devoted mother and a loving wife, these facets of her character are born out in the large group of general and family letters that form the most important part of the records that relate to her. She had four sons and four daughters. Among her many trials in life were the death of her favourite son Cuthbert in 1876 at the age of 26 and the absence of her husband who spent nearly three years in India. Despite these she appears constantly cheerful and very capable of bringing up three of her children through the formative years of their lives, without her husband's help. When he returned in 1876 he was virtually an invalid and so she had this added burden too. Robert Druitt, the eldest son was born in April 1847, he was educated at Westminster and Christchurch, Oxford. He afterwards became a solicitor and later entered into partnership with his uncle James Druitt in Christchurch, Hants, (his cousin James, son of his uncle James also began a solicitor's practise in Bournemouth with another cousin William Harvey Druitt, son of his uncle William.) He married Alice May Tupper, the daughter of Daniel Tupper, who will be referred to later in the introduction. He became, later in life, very much involved in disputes over Church matters in Christchurch as well as other local affairs. Charles Druitt (nicknamed 'Pope' by the family), the second son was born in November 1848 and was educated at St. Paul's, London and Exeter College, Oxford. He was ordained Deacon by the Bishop of Ripon in 1871 and Priest by the Bishop of Salisbury in 1873. He was curate at Penistone in Yorkshire, at Weymouth and at Parkstone in Dorset. In 1886 he was admitted a missioner for the 'Society of St. Andrew' in the Salisbury diocese. In 1888 he became vicar of East and West Harnham and in 1891 vicar of Whitechurch Canonicorum. He married Isabel Hill in 1888 and died in 1900 Cuthbert Druitt, the third son was born in June 1850. He entered the Royal Navy in 1864 and retired in 1875 with the rank of Lieutenant. In the same year he went to South America as Manager of the works of the Malpaso Gold Washing Company in 1875 and a year later married Elizabeth Foulds in Jamaica. He died in 1876 in Honda, Columbia Isabella Druitt, the eldest daughter was born in May 1852 and married Major Horace Miles Hobart-Hampden [Second son of the Duke of Buckingham] Lionel Druitt (nicknamed 'Ghost'), the youngest sone was born in May 1854 and following in his father's footsteps entered the medical profession. He became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1875 a master in surgery at Edinburgh in 1877 and a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in the same year. He practised mainly in London in Clapham Road and Strathmore Gardens and emigrated to Cooma, New South Wales in 1886. From there he moved to Tasmania in 1891. He married Susan Cunningham in 1888 and died in 1907 in Australia Emily Druitt (nicknamed 'Owl') was born in February 1856 and died c. 1928 She was a good musician, excelling in the playing of the violin and a number of concert programmes survive, and she also had an interest in literature. Katherine Druitt, the third daughter was born in July 1858 and died in June 1887. Gertrude Druitt, (nicknamed 'Tooty') the youngest child was born in December 1862 and it was she who compiled the pedigree and papers relating to the family history that are found in the collection. There are also a number of letters to her. She died in 1900\nArrangement: The collection was deposited in a large trunk in which at some stage it had been placed. The bundles of letters were retained together wherever possible, although most of the general material was lying loose and apparently in no order. The records have been grouped and listed under the name of the person, who wrote them or to whom they relate. Where they were loose an attempt has been made under the name headings an to place them in categories where they will be of most use. The index will help to locate any paper that might appear to be in an illogical place. The groups of letters have been sorted into chronological order and then the annual bundles have been put into alphabetical order. They have been bound into volumes to facilitate their use and protect them and an index to them can be found at the front of each volume. The remaining papers have been repaired cleaned, protected and stored in boxes.",

        "Context Description": "LEWIS COURT BIBLE CHRISTIAN COLLECTION.",
        "Title": "From Revd. [John] Kenner at 423 Dufferin Avenue, London, Ontario, Canada, to [Lewis] Court.",
        "Description": "He was very pleased to receive Court's letter re C. Backer?? [The rest of this paragraph is very difficult to read]. Court is mistaken in thinking that Kenner has a memoir of [unreadable word]. Kenner attended the Conference at Plymouth in 1855, at which he received his first appointment to the Scilly Isles. At that Conference he remembers Joseph H. [unreadable surname] preaching? At that same Conference the late [Frederick William] Bourne, William [Billy] Bray and a number of others, were received into full connexion. Brother [Cephas Barker] was also present at Conference. He had a lofty forehead, a keen eye and thick lips. His general aspect was stern and commanding, but children everywhere loved him. Kenner was unable to attend the Conference of 1856, at which Barker was appointed Superintendent of Ministers at Prince Edward Island, Canada. After nine years there he was sent to Ontario, where in 1871 Kenner made his acquaintance. Barker filled all the offices of the Church and was President of Conference in the year of Kenner's arrival in Canada. He was also editor of two weekly newspapers and one Sunday School instructor, and for ten years was the Treasurer of the Mission and Connexional Funds. During his time as treasurer, the funds were \u00a360,000 in debt. To administer such a fund was a major drain on his time and energy. Barker had a great capacity for work. Even so, the Church laid too much upon him and he never learned to say no. He possessed a strong constitution but in the long term the pressure was too much for him to bear. On the night of Sunday 14th November 1881 after a hard days work, Barker took some refreshment and retired for the night. He was dead by morning Reference is made to Barker's visit to England [in 1880], during which time he was relieved of all Connexional duties. Upon his return to Canada, he assumed the pastorate?? of Horton Street Church in London, Ontario. As far as Kenner knows, Barker had only one child, a daughter by his first wife. She married and moved away from the area. Her present whereabouts are unknown. Barker's widow either disposed of her husband's effects or took them with her to the Isle of Wight from where she originally came. She has since died and the Church has none of his effects from which to glean further information. Revd. [John] Harris succeeded Barker in the editorship of the Bowmanville Observer [of Ontario]. If anyone in Canada could give more information about his predecessor it would be him. Two years ago, Kenner's wife?? died and he had to dispose of 1200 volumes and many bound volumes of the Connexional Newspaper to various ex-members of the Bible Christian Church [part of the united Canadian Methodist Church since 1884]. Kenner is therefore unable to comply with Court's request to give further details of Barker's visit to England [1880]. [John] Hicks Eynon died in Exeter on March 22nd 1888 at the age of 87, and was buried in the same place. Court also asked about Kenner himself, which of course is a very familiar subject. Kenner was born in the parish of Lanest, Cornwall, on June 20th 1836. He was converted? at Bridgetown in Devon in 1854, and became a preacher the following year. His first station was the Scilly Isles. He married in 1861 and in 1871 after finishing a term as Superintendent of the South Wales district moved to Canada. Kenner includes a full list of his home and Canadian Stations and length of service - see Oliver Beckerlegge's U M Ministers and their Circuits (1968). He thus enjoyed forty-four years uninterrupted service as an active minister. He was honoured by his brethren with the office of Conference President in 1875. Kenner also served three years as Conference Secretary, three years as Missions Secretary and eight years as Treasurer of the Connexional Funds. When Kenner first arrived in Canada about one half of the brethren who had emigrated from England were members of the English Preachers' Annuity Society. [The rest of this passage is very difficult to read, but discusses in detail the problems of Connexional finance]. At Kenner's suggestion, the Canadian Conference started their own fund for the benefit of preachers. He also negotiated with [Frederick William] Bourne?? a separation of the funds of the English and Canadian Bible Christian Connexions. Reference is also made to financial negotiations at the time of Canadian union in 1884. In recognition of his services Kenner was presented with a gold watch on 19th June 1883. The watch still keeps good time after thirty-three years. Kenner was one of five children - three boys and two girls. His oldest sister died in 1855 and was buried with their father in Tregarl? Methodist Cemetery. His youngest sister passed away in the city of [either Manchester, England or more probably Hamilton, Ontario] twelve years ago on January 3rd. All three brothers entered the Bible Christian ministry. Henry came out to Canada in 1861 and was joined by William and John in 1871. The oldest brother was William, who died last September at the age of eighty-six in the city of Peterborough. Henry is still alive at the age of eighty-four and is living in Winnipeg. Kenner completed sixty years as a minister last July and will celebrate his 81st birthday, if spared, on June 20th next. On June 27th [1914] his wife died. They were happily married for fifty-three years. The April following, his youngest son died suddenly and in the September his eldest brother as before mentioned. This information is personal but Court did ask for it. On the whole, God has been good to Kenner. People here are very kind and his health is remarkably good. Indeed, for his age he remains very active. Kenner has never been what is popularly known as a 'Revivalist' although he has experienced some manifestations of God's grace in the conversion of sinners. He feels that his ministry has been most successful in the area of 'personal appeal' The church here is well equipped with a choir of between sixty and seventy. An organ which in the past year has had \u00a315,000 spent on it, adds to the effect. Kenner has three meals a day provided for him and a daughter who is kindness personified. He keeps himself occupied visiting the sick and ministering to the poor. He has a voracious appetite for reading and follows John Wesley's advice regarding early rising. Kenner was converted during the month of March sixty-eight years ago on a Sunday evening after listening to a sermon by a local preacher William Kitto. His text was 'The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own wages'. The scene of his conversion was not a church but a hayloft. He knows from irrefutable evidence that he was called to God's ministry. One of the assets which Kenner enjoyed when he entered the ministry, was an appreciation of his own ignorance. At the time he knew practically nothing of men or books. He recalls that on his way to take up his first ministerial appointment [Scilly Isles], he noticed on a bookstall in Penzance a book called [unreadable title]. He knew nothing of the author but as it dealt with God, man and redemption, he felt that it would probably be very valuable. You can imagine his surprise therefore, when he discovered that the author's intention was to destroy faith in religious truth. He read the book as well as the writings of Voltaire, Volney??, Bolling?? and Thomas Paine. In 1862, he also studied the works of Bishop [John William] Colenso on the authenticity of the Bible. [The rest of this paragraph is very difficult to read]. Spritual matters are discussed in detail. Reference is made to Revd. C.Backer?? During [Frederick William] Bourne's lifetime, Kenner subscribed to the Bible Christian Magazine and Bourne also sent him any interesting snippets of Connexional information. Kenner should really have continued to take the magazine of the United Methodist Church [post-1907] but was not approached to do so, and therefore reached the conclusion that if the new management were not concerned with retaining their old subscribers, then he would let the matter drop. When Brothers [William Blake] Lark and [John] Luke were attending the Ecumenical [Conference], Kenner spoke with Luke and sent him the Canadian denominational [unreadable word] for the preceding twelve months in return for Luke sending him the Minutes of the British Conference Magazine or anything concerning the progress of the United Methodist Church. Luke must have been either forgetful or sick as Kenner has never heard from him. Kenner will forward the year book with a paragraph written by Kenner's brother Henry. On the back of the slip which was sent with Court's photograph, is a picture of Revd.[Arthur] Hancock. Kenner was particularly pleased to receive this, as he thinks that he knew Hancock as a child. On occasion, he used to sleep at the house of Hancock's father, who used to be a local preacher of great worth in the Bodmin Circuit. His mother was likewise a model of womanly virtue. She was a refined woman of great culture with a perfect command of herself and her children. [The rest of the paragraph is very difficult to read]. Should Court see Hancock, he should pas on an old man's blessing. If Court ever succeeds in 'deciphering these hieroglyphics, I think I shall have inflicted sufficient penalty on you for writing me: and I presume when I recover my memory and steadiness of hand to try and be a little plainer in my writing.' In a postscript he mentions that he has just been reading a work on the work in China by Revd. G.S. Bond?? and he noticed several references to the British missionary Samuel Pollard. Kenner was present at the Portsmouth Conference [1886], which appointed Pollard and [Francis John] Dymond to that work, voting \u00a3100 towards the establishment of the scheme. How has the mission prospered? Are those two worthy gentlemen still there? He sees that Pollard has enabled the Bible Society to provide the [montagnard Miao] people with bibles in their own language, which is surely an achievement to be proud of and thankful for.\nAdministrative history: John Kenner (b.1834) was born in Cornwall and entered the Bible Christian ministry in 1855. He emigrated to Canada in 1871 and held several pastoral positions in Ontario. Kenner served as President of the Canadian Conference in 1875, Secretary of Conference in 1877 and 1880 and Connexional treasurer for eight years. In 1884 he transferred to the Canadian Methodist Church. Kenner's two brothers Henry and William were also Bible Christian ministers, who served in Britain and Canada Source: Beckerlegge John Harris entered the Canadian Bible Christian ministry in 1863, serving as Secretary of Conference in 1883. He transferred to the Canadian Methodist Church in 1884 Source: Beckerlegge John Hicks Eynon (1801-88) was born in Gloucester, and was converted by the early female itinerant Elizabeth Dart, whom he later married. He entered the Bible Christian ministry in 1826, and after service in several home circuits, was appointed to Upper Canada in 1832. He remained in Canada for the remainder of his ministry and pioneered the work of the Church across large areas of the colony Source: Beckerlegge and Bourne, pp.214-217, 303, 519",

        "Description": "INTRODUCTION This is the forty fourth volume of Additional Manuscripts (Add Mss) to have been catalogued in the West Sussex Record office and it has been compiled, in general, along the lines indicated in the introduction to the first volume in November 1956 The class of Additional Manuscripts embraces all the smaller gifts and deposits of documents received by the West Sussex Record Office, as distinct from the large family and estate collections, such as Goodwood MSS.; or accumulations from solicitors' offices, such as Oglethorpe and Anderson MSS.; collections of official bodies, such as Quarter Sessions records; or collections from other bodies, such as the records of the Royal Sussex Regiment, each of which is referred to and quoted by name. The majority of Additional Manuscripts have been deeds of title, though increasingly a healthy balance of a vast range of other original material has been catalogued in these volumes. However the pressure of the sheer weight of material to be catalogued has meant that since volume 29 in March 1983, the catalogues of title deeds, instead of being the detailed calendars that had been prepared until that date, have mainly been summary lists, with the emphasis being placed on the property concerned in the transaction, rather than on the parties involved, or the technicalities of the type of legal conveyance being used. From the thirty sixth volume in November 1987, the accession number of each collection catalogued is given at the head of each separate catalogue The documents listed in this catalogue range in date from a deed of property in Midhurst, 1543 (Add Mss 47473) to the Sussex County Veterans track and field rankings, 1994 (Add Mss 47681).

        "Title": "Additional Manuscripts, catalogue 43",
        "Description": "This is the forty third volume of Additional Manuscripts (Add Mss) to have been catalogued in the West Sussex Record Office and it has been compiled, in general, along the lines indicated in the introduction to the first volume in November 1956 The class of Additional Manuscripts embraces all the smaller gifts and deposits of documents received by the West Sussex Record Office, as distinct from the large family and estate collections, such as the Goodwood Mss, or accumulations from solicitors' offices, such as Oglethorpe and Anderson Mss; collections of official bodies, such as Quarter Sessions Records; or collections from other bodies, such as the Records of the Royal Sussex Regiment, each of which is referred to and quoted by name. The majority of Additional Manuscripts have been deeds of title, though increasingly a healthy balance of a vast range of other original material has been catalogued in these volumes. However, the pressure of the sheer weight of material to be catalogued has meant that since volume twenty nine in March 1983, the catalogues of title deeds, instead of being the detailed calendars that had been prepared until that date, have mainly been catalogued in summary lists, with the emphasis being placed on the property concerned in the transaction, rather than on the parties involved, or the technicalities of the type of legal conveyance being used. From the thirty sixth volume in November 1987, the Accession number of each collection catalogued is given at the head of each separate catalogue This catalogue includes literary papers, such as the diaries, scrap books and press cuttings books of Lillian F. Ramsay, better known as 'Mrs. Paddick' (Add Mss 46195-46244); a loose page from the memoranda book of James Dallaway, 1811 (Add Mss 46485); additional papers and correspondence of Robert Gittings, 1913-1983 (Add Mss 46503-46515); and memorabilia relating to Hilaire Belloc, 1870-1953 (Add Mss 46810-46817). There are scrap books, press notices and play bills of Serge Levien and the Bognor Regis Repertory Company, 1939-1968 (Add Mss 46349-46351), and records of Harting Whit Monday Festivities, 1965-1975 (Add Mss 46609-46612). As well as the usual deeds of title, there are a number of collections of records of Womens Institutes in the county, such as Add Mss 46272-46348, 46445-46484, 46539-46573 and 46864-46944 and records of Chichester Summersdale Towns Womens Guild, 1942-1986 (Add Mss 46528-46538). There are two theses: Revd. C.J.C. Hewitt, 'Bishop G.K.A. Bell of Chichester: A Study of his work in relation to the Second World War', 1992 (Add Mss 46574), and J.M. Lee, Private Schools in Bognor Regis and District, 1830-1960', 1989 (Add Mss 46699). The documents range in date from a title deed of Trenchmers in Cowfold, 1535 (Add Mss 46079) to papers of Raymond Andrews, relating to his association with Cecil Jackson-Cole, 1993 (Add Mss 46617) No index has been provided for this volume, as all the relevant details of this and all previous volumes have been included in the card indexes of persons, places, manors and subjects, which are to be found in the Search Room of the West Sussex Record Office Searchers are again asked to exercise care in quoting references, and to use the form Add Mss (or Mss) followed by the relevant number or numbers.

        "Description": "Records of West Sussex Record Office Additional Manuscripts INTRODUCTION This is the forty ninth volume of Additional Manuscripts (Add Mss) to have been catalogued in the West Sussex Record office and it has been compiled, in general, along the lines indicated in the introduction to the first volume in November 1956 The class of Additional Manuscripts embraces all the smaller gifts and deposits of documents received by the West Sussex Record Office, as distinct from the large family and estate collections, such as Goodwood MSS.; or accumulations from solicitors' offices, such as Oglethorpe and Anderson Mss.; collections of official bodies, such as Quarter Sessions records; or collections from other bodies, such as the records of the Royal Sussex Regiment, each of which is referred to and quoted by name. The majority of Additional Manuscripts have been deeds of title, though increasingly a healthy balance of a vast range of other original material has been catalogued in these volumes. However the pressure of the sheer weight of material to be catalogued has meant that since volume 29 in March 1983, the catalogues of title deeds, instead of being the detailed calendars that had been prepared until that date, have mainly been summary lists, with the emphasis being placed on the property concerned in the transaction, rather than on the parties involved, or the technicalities of the type of legal conveyance being used. From the thirty sixth volume in November 1987, the accession number of each collection catalogued is given at the head of each separate catalogue The documents listed in this catalogue range in date from a certificate concerning the tithes of Hurstpierpoint, 1607 (Add Mss 52,546) to a funeral tribute to the Rev. John H. Bishop by his son Michael Bishop, 2001 (Add Mss 52,384). As well as the usual deeds of title, there are manorial records, such as those for the manor of Cocking, 1823-1841 (Add Mss 52,553), and maps, including those for Ashfold Lodge in Lower Beeding and Slaugham (Add Mss 52,352) and South Mundham Farm in Pagham and North Mundham, 1637 (Add Mss 52,637). Records of organisations include those of Chichester Festival Theatre Society, 1997-1998 (Add Mss 52,266-52,268); Chichester Young Farmers Club, 1948 (Add Mss 52,283); West Chiltington Women's Institute, 1988-1994 (Add Mss 52,394-52,395), various other Women's Institutes, 1919-1997 (Add Mss 52,474-52,545); the Medical Women's Federation (Sussex section), 1967-1993 (Add Mss 52,620-52,630), and the Sussex Ornithological Society, 1945-1999 (Add Mss 52,699-53,499). Records of Sports Clubs include those of Chichester Priory Park Cricket Club, 1971-1997 (Add Mss 52,355-52,381 and 52,619) and South Bersted and Bognor Regis Cricket Club, 1936-1991 (Add Mss 52,559-52,580). There are a number of theses, including studies of General George Goring, 1608-1657 (Add Mss 52,275); clerical influence on a nineteenth-century estate in Sussex (Add Mss 52,382); the Parham Estate (Add Mss 52,465), and Sir William Burnett and the medical staffing of the Royal Navy, 1815-1856 (Add Mss 52,638). There is correspondence and literary miscellanea of Edward Heron-Allen (Add Mss 52,466-52,469, 52,633-52,636, and 52,642); William Hayley (Add Mss 52,473) and the Rev. P.H. Francis (Add Mss 52,319) No index has been provided for this volume, as all the relevant details of this and all previous volumes have been included in the card indexes of persons, places, manors and subjects, which are to be found in the Search Room of the West Sussex Record Office Searchers are again asked to exercise care in quoting references, and to use the form Add Mss (or MSS.) followed by the relevant number or numbers.

Newberry 'Proposed Rebuilding of Liskeard Church Tower. A Protest'. (Condemns competition announced in October 1896 for designs to be submitted on grounds of insufficient instructions and that the Norman Tower at present there could not be rebuilt as granite and not local stone was specified. No reason why Norman tower should not be restored, even if detached campanile erected for the bells). 6. 'Copy of The Builders Journal and Architectural Journal' for 16 December 1896 with news item about vandalism of proposed new church tower for which competition for designs had been advertised. Committee wanted to spend \u00a33000 on new tower. Leading architect (= G. Fellowes Prynne though original tower could be restored for \u00a3800). 7/1-2. Two letters from Assistant Secretary of Society of Antiquaries (W. H. St. John Hope) asking if it is possible for old tower to be restored without rebuilding it. Second letter mentions Prynne's report from it is clear that the Norman work need not be pulled down. Asks for reconsideration by the Committee. Both letters (20 January and 9 February 1897) are addressed to the Vicar, the Revd. J. Norris. 8. Plan for new church tower 'preserving characteristic portions of the present tower and restoration of Norman tower-arch and the west doorway. Second premiated design by H. P. Burke Downing, F.R.I.B.A, F.S.I.' from 'The Architect', 12 March 1897. 9. Copy of letter from Robert M. Paul, Chancellor of Truro Diocese) to Arthur Burch, Diocesan Registry, Exeter. Has considered reports of Mr. Sedding and Mr. Prynne on Liskeard Tower. Prynne deprecated removal of existing tower; Sedding thought it could be re-erected. Chancellor thought that proposed new design for tower was totally distinct from the ancient tower. Prynne and Sedding both thought tower was dilapidated and that it must be taken down. Chancellor prepared to grant a faculty without formality of calling a (Consistory) Court but if petitioners would not adopt his suggestions, he would have to call on some independent architect to inspect the tower and produce a report at the expense of the petitioners. 17 May 1897. 10. Copy reply of the Vicar of Liskeard to A. Burch about no. 9, the Chancellor's letter, Mr. Sedding provided the design chosen for the new tower from 25 competition exhibits. Mr. Burke was second (see no. 8, above). Parishioners approved the plans at a Vestry held on 21 May. Architect: Mr. Sansom to incorporate everything of interest in the old tower into the new tower. Asks Chancellor to reconsider and grant a faculty, 22 May 1897. 11. Another letter of Vicar of Liskeard (rough copy) to A. Burch asking Chancellor Paul to reconsider, 26 May 1897. Wants to rebuild tower in proportion to church (pointed out in letter 10 that Norman tower did not fit proportions of present church). Would not Chancellor Paul visit Liskeard to see for himself? 12. Copy of letter from Chancellor Robert M. Paul to Arthur Burch. Paul had considered Vicard of Liskeard's letters of 24 & 26 May and Vicar had sent a photograph of the tower. Had seen tower recently and thought nothing to be gained by going to see it with the Vicar unless accompanied by an independent architect of his own selection whose expenses would have to be borne by the Petitioners. Having had reports from two reputable architects he thinks it necessary to take down the existing tower and to rebuild it as far as possible on the original lines. Will not grant a faculty, 1 June 1897. 13. Original of P.126/2/27/12. 14. Chancellor R. M. Paul to the Revd. J. Norris deprecating comments in the 'Cornish Times' when matter 'subjudice' and Vicar's statement that 'on no account will the Committee re-erect the Tower nor pay 1 the cost of any further engagement of expert or experts'. 15. Note on necessity of legal sanction of the bishop for alteration in fabric etc. of church buildings. This expressed by a faculty (From Sir R. Phillimore's 'Ecclesiastical Law' ii, 1792). 16. Copy of letter from The Revd. J. Norris to Town Clerk of Liskeard calling attention of the Mayor and Corporation and the Borough Surveyor to the unsafeness of the Tower. 10 June 1897. 17.

Paull to Vicar 24 May and J. Norris to Arthur Burch of 22 May (see no. 10). Copies of originals of 11, 12 and 13, 14. Tower Committee discussed. Vicar prepared to pull tower down and take the risk. Some said it was ridiculous to preserve or copy present tower which was out of harmony with rest of church. Others that money was available (\u00a31000 legacy) etc. for new tower but could not be used. Discussion whether a faculty necessary or not. Vicar proposed to call on Mayor and Corporation as Urban Sanitary, Authority to examine the tower as he (the Vicar) had responsibility for the safety of the tower. Meeting adjourned till 24 June. Also printed editorial comment from 'Cornish Times' of June 12th 1897 - editor thought it was foolish 'to take down the existing tower only to erect in its place a counterpart of the old, which was built for another nave and is in another style of architecture, besides being unsightly and ill-proportioned to the fine Church' etc. Question vital as tower in a bad condition). 18(a) Letter from the Secretaries of the Royal Institute of British Architects to Vicar and Churchwardens of Liskeard stating that the old (Norman) tower could be made perfectly sound at a cost of about \u00a3700. Protest against threatened demolition of the old tower. \u00a31000 legacy left for new tower and parishioners could raise a further \u00a32000. No objection to new tower being erected in another part of the Churchyard 'indeed there is good evidence that up to the time of Henry VIII the Church had two Towers'. This new tower could contain the bells. Act of vandalism if the old tower were destroyed. 18(b) Copy of Vicar's reply to 17 - they had no business to write such a preposterous letter. 19. Reply to secretaries of the Royal Institute of British Architects to 18(b). 20/1-11. File of letters (1. Extract from Chancellors letter to the Registrar - 'I think it might be the duty of the Court to discourage rather than sanction the destruction of the Tower'..

Burch to Vicar of Liskeard, 21 April 1897-20 August 1897 relating to Faculty. Chancellor to nominate experts; petitioners to pay them. P.126/2/27/20/5 copy letter from Chancellor Robert M. Paul to the Registrar, Arthur M. Burch. Paul had considered reports of Mr. Sedding and Mr. Prynne. Latter deprecates moving existing tower; Sedding in favour of re-erecting the present tower. New tower proposed at Liskeard totally different in style and dimensions. Both architects see need for present tower to be taken down 'and if the Committee could see their way to re-erecting the present tower and submitting fresh plans I should raise no further difficulty' etc. P.126/2/27/20/7 also letter from R. M. Paul to A Burch - is prepared not to insist on exact reproduction of the existing tower, provided 'there is no unneccessary departure from the general style and design of such existing tower'. P.126/2/27/20/10. A. Burch - the Revd. J. Norris, if petitioners dissatisfied with Chancellor Paul's decision 'they have an appeal to the Court of Arches'. P.126/2/27/20/11. Mr. Ponting appointed as assessor in matter of Liskeard Church Tower requires hole to be dug to bottom of foundations of the Tower (20 August 1897). 21/1-19. Batch of letters and copies of letters between Dr. Gott, bishop of Truro, and the Revd. J. Norris 15 June 1897 -4 Jan. 1898. Bishop said it was not Truro v. Liskeard - Chancellor only happened to live in Truro. Liskeard must accept his decision or appeal to a higher court. The Vicar of Liskeard could not defy the law and thereby act irresponsibly. By letter of 16 Oct 1897, it seems Vicar and people of Liskeard had agreed to rebuild 'stone for stone their Tower, so far as the ancient material is capable and worthy and to heighten it'. Oct. 15 Vicar and Wardens willing to meet Chancellor Paul. By Nov. 27 it seems there was to be an appeal to a Higher court. 23 Dec. 1897 Chancellor to Vicar asking if 'the majority of the parishioners are favorable to your application and whether you have grounds for beliving that money would be forthcoming to pay for the rebuilding of the tower on the lines now suggested'. Jan. 4th 1898 Bp.'s chaplain to Mr. Norris - Bishop is glad that the Tower question is now satisfactorily settled'. 22/1-2 Letter and card of C.E. Ponting, F.S.A., of Marlborough, architect to Vicar of Liskeard, thanking him for arrangements for inspecting the Tower. 23 & 26 September 1897. 23. Cutting from 'Cornish Times' 25 September 1897 about Chanceller of Truro (R. M. Paul) assisted by Mr. Ponting, architect, Salisbury, as assessor, sat at Liskeard to inquire into a petition from the vicar and churchwardens for a faculty to take down and rebuild the church tower. E.

        "Title": "Hampson Archive",
        "Description": "The Leonard Hampson Executors' Archive was deposited in 1980s and consists of the letters that John Gibbard received relating to the affairs of his father in law Leonard Hampson of Luton. A couple of items relate to Hampson before he died but the bulk refers to John Gibbard's executorship of Hampson's will. Correspondence between Hampson and Gibbard in 1822 has survived in the Garrard and Allen Archive (GA 2493).\nAdministrative history: Leonard Hampson was baptised on the 21 October 1759 at Luton St Mary, the son of William and Ann Hampson. William was a lawyer and banker of considerable local importance. In 1759 he purchased the George and Red Lion Inns from Francis Herne of Luton Hoo. His own house was in George Street next to the Inn itself. William was also steward of the Manor of Luton from 1774-1795. In 1774 he was a trustee of the Luton Road Trust. On William's death in 1799, his eldest surviving son Leonard took over both the Bank and the Solicitor's firm and joined into a partnership with John Griffiths covering both businesses. On Griffith's death, Edward Chilwell Williamson became Leonard's partner in the solicitor's business. Charles Austin, a solicitor of Hertford and a nephew of Griffiths became Hampson's partner at the Bank. Hampson followed in his father's footsteps. By 1794 he had become Under Sheriff and his two businesses prospered. By the 1811 Poor Law Rate he was paying \u00a342, 15s rates, as one of the largest landowners in Luton. Hampson split the costs of the Luton Enclosure Act in 1810 with the Marquess of Bute. In the 1810s he acted as one of the sureties for his son-in-law, John Gibbard, as Receiver General of Bedfordshire Land Tax. Leonard Hampson, The Hawes Inheritance Leonard Hampson married Frances Smith (1763-1811) on 13 July 1786 at Cardington. Frances was the only child of the Reverend William Smith and his wife Mary. Smith was Vicar of St Paul's Bedford and Prebendary of Lincoln Cathedral 1749-1782. He was also Rector of Barton-in-the Clay 1757-1782. He died on 6 May 1782 aged 57. His wife Mary (1734-1809) was a member of the well known Hawes family of Bedford. On the death of her brother John Hawes of Cardington in 1802, she inherited Porch House 187 acres of land in and around Bedford. The estate had been in the ownership of John and Mary Hawes' father Thomas at least by 1721 but the family had been prominent in the town since the 16th Century and included Thomas Hawes (John Hawes' great great great grandfather) who endowed the Hawes Charity (Charity Commission Report 120 in Search Room). The estate had been substantially altered at the time of the enclosure of the area of Bedford north of the river in 1797, so that by 1802 it consisted of Porch House (on the corner of Allhallows and Midland Road on a site now occupied by H Samuels - see R Wildman 'Bygone Bedford', photograph 6), a garden (1R 38P) Further Hill Close (6A 2R 26P) garden and enclosure of pasture (6A, 0R, 9P) 1st Allotment (meadow) (7A 2R 1P) Prebend Field (61A OR 28P) and Windmill Field (53A, OR, 5P). On Mary Smith's death in 1809 the estate passed to her daughter Frances but effective control passed to Leonard Hampson. On 16 June 1809, 160 Acres OR 17P were auctioned. Only part of the estate sold but it included two parts of the 61 Acres OR 28P awarded to John Hawes in Prebend Field with part of Sadlers Corner Close. This was purchased by J T Dawson. He and his family kept it as agricultural land and it remained undeveloped till the 1880s. Frances only lived until 1811 and then Hampson became the owner of the estate with ultimate reversion to his and Frances' two children Frances and Mary. Frances married Thomas Anderson Rudd in 1811 and Mary to John Gibbard of Sharnbrook (1774-1849) in 1812. So on Leonard's death in March 1824, the two daughters inherited the estate. The archive consists of one letter and solicitor's bill to John Gibbard relating to his mortgages on his Sharnbrook estates before Hampson's death and fifteen letters etc relating to Gibbard's executorship of Hampson's will. (a)John Gibbard's mortgages Between 1814 and 1822 John Gibbard clearly needed to raise considerable sums of money on mortgage and he did so with Hampson's help. X808/1 mentions Gibbard trying to raise at least \u00a312,000 in this way. Why Gibbard was so short of money is not immediately obvious. Some of the money undoubtedly represented unpaid purchase money. Extra money was perhaps allocated to general improvements to his Sharnbrook estate following the enclosure of the Parish in 1809. The period 1815-1822 saw the onset of a sharp depression in farm prices following the end of the artificially high prices caused by the Napoleonic Wars. This depression hit farmers worst of all but landlords too cannot have been unaffected. (b)Leonard Hampson's estate 1824-1838 The bulk of the correspondence however relates to the settling of Hampson's affairs following his death in March 1824. (He was buried on 12 March at St Mary's Luton). Austin had got sufficient capital to buy out Hampson's share of the Bank and so almost immediately the Executors decided to close it. Robert Hibbert, junior of East Hyde wrote to Gibbard on 11 March 1824, expressing concern that the considerable feeling on the issue might spill out into a riot even to the extent of Hampson's coffin being stopped on the way to the Church. In June 1824, the executors started to clear Hampson's personal estate. A list of his deeds was prepared which included Mortgages in his favour, the marriage settlement of his brother Edward with Susannah Cecil Grave, dated 28 October 1783 and for purchases of individual closes of land in Pepperstock and Wheathamstead. This was sent to the Executors on 1 June. A sale notice appeared in the Northampton Mercury of 12 June 1824 announcing the sale of Hampson's personal goods on 23 June. On the 13th Rudd wrote to Gibbard detailing what items were to be bought in at the auction. (X808/9) At a fairly early date the Executors decided to sell the remainder of the Hawes estate for Building Land. Mr T Wood of Leighton Buzzard advertised the sale in the Huntingdon, Bedford and Peterborough Gazette and Cambridge and Hertford Independent Press of 16 October 1824. A copy of that sale notice is to be found at the end of this introduction. From accounts rendered in July 1825 (X808/13), it is clear that the Executors got an extremely good price for the land and the purchasers saw the development potential of the land. For 58A 1R 30P they raised \u00a37,053 over \u00a3120 per acre. The first two lots lay to the west of the land that Hampson had sold off in Prebend Field in 1809. They lay to the west of the town beyond Midland Road and lying between Bromham Road and Ford End Road. Although the first lot was purchased by Green, it very soon was purchased by Dr Brereton, Master of Bedford School. The purchaser of the second and third lots was Robert Elliott. Although the land had been bought at a high price, Elliott did not develop the land for residential housing, building only one house at the Bromham Road end by 1846 which was occupied as a small farm. Part of the southern end was used for building the Midland Railway Station, open 1857 and the track north of it. By the 1850s the northern part was used as a nursery occupied firstly by James Sheppard and then by Mrs Horton, florist. In the early 1890s both the northern and southern part of this property was sold off as the site of Allens Works. Lot 4 Sadlers Corner represented the last piece of Hawes land on the north side of the Tavistock Street. The land was sold to Thomas Gwyn Elger, builder. Unlike the Dawson's who had kept the land they had bought in the area as agricultural land, Elger developed the land quickly providing cheap housing. The 1851 Census for Canning Street reveals that out of 17 Heads of Household there were 1 Tobacco Pipemakmer Master, a baker, a sergeant in Bedfordshire Militia, two shoemakers, 3 bricklayers, 1 stonemason, two brickmaker's labourers, a farm labourer and 5 general labourers. Canning Street had been built by 1827 and Russell and Chandos Street by 1830. Note the evenhanded compliments to leaders of both political parties of the day. Canning was Prime Minister in 1827 but by 1830 Russell and the Reform Bill were in the ascendant. 'Chandos' was an attempt, perhaps to give a ducal air to some unducal houses! North of the houses on the northern side of Russell Street there were no houses till the 1880s, when the Dawsons sold off 14 Acres to G D Langley, the Bedford schoolmaster in 1882. He sold it on to the British Land Company in August 1883, who sold the whole area of in building plots on 29 October 1885. Houses appeared in the Black Tom area ie Park Road, Stanley Street, Clarendon Street, Garfield Street and Beaconsfield Street soon afterwards. [AD39] The last 3 lots were all purchased with a view to immediate building in the area now covered by the Crescent and Hawes Street. James Woodroffe, the well known Bedford architect purchased the site of 12 The Crescent and no doubt designed that house and the neighbour to the north, No 10, built by John Austin, builder of High Street, Bedford (see X208). Interestingly William Berrill of Bedford, bricklayer was also a party to the deed of 1825 where Austin purchased the site of No 10. West of the property was the lot purchased by the Reverend Thomas Short and no doubt includes the present Hawes Street (developed 1835 as Hampson Street but will its present name by 1836). In conclusion the release of this substantial piece, so close to the town, provided an important stimulus to the development of the New Town of the 1820s.\nNote: '",

It was not, however, the only area of activity with the aim of improving the social and political situation of women in Britain. Earlier in the century, the idea of the 'sacred' protective duty of women gave them a 'high' ideological status in society that far outstripped their legal status. The social work that was undertaken by women's groups in the areas of housing and nursing led to changes regarding national laws on the poor, education and the treatment of the infirm. However, despite these achievements, the women who were responsible for them still found themselves legally impotent. This was also a time when the proportion of women compared with men in the country was increasing and the number of unmarried women without the expected financial support of a husband was growing as a consequence. Reformers therefore began to focus on the most immediate ways of improving the status and economic position of women, focusing on improvements to female education and the employment opportunities available to them. Schemes in the 1860s such as Emily Faithfull's Victoria Press and the plethora of female emigration societies that sprang up at the time and directed by individuals such as Maria Rye were designed to give women who were reasonably educated the means of supporting themselves. These developments were followed by activities centred on women's legal status regarding property and their ability to stand for election at the local level. None of the strands of activity was independent from the other as attitudes towards one affected perceptions of the others, and those who were active in one area such as women's employment also worked with colleagues more commonly associated with others such as education. Biographies: Barbara Bodichon (1827-1891) n\u00e9e Leigh Smith was born in 1827. Her father was a progressive educationalist and MP for Norwich. Bodichon was the cousin of Florence Nightingale. Bodichon was educated at Westminster Infants School, a pioneering 'ragged school' and later at Bedford College. Thanks to her father Bodichon was financially independent. In 1852 Bodichon opened Portman Hill School in Paddington, a non-denominational, non-conventional school of mixed social class, which she ran together with Elizabeth Whitehead. Bodichon campaigned for women's rights, collecting signatures for the Married Women's Property Bill in 1856 and writing 'Women and Work' in 1857. Also in 1857 she married Eugene Bodichon a French doctor. She helped finance 'The Englishwoman's Journal' and was co-proprietor, with Miss Bessie Rayner Parkes of the Journal from 1858 to 1864. Bodichon was on the committee of the Female Middle Class Emigration Society from 1861 to 1886. Bodichon also read the first papers on suffrage in 1865, supported the first suffrage petition in 1866 and became Secretary of the Suffrage Committee in 1867. Bodichon fought for higher education for women and helped Emily Davies to found the college that later became Girton. Barbara Bodichon died in 1891. Frances Power Cobbe (1822-1904) was a traveller and journalist, who was also a keen promoter of the emancipation of women. Cobbe was an early member of the Kensington Society, the Enfranchisment of Women Committee and later a founder of the London National Society for Women's Suffrage and a member of the executive committee of the Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage. She was also a member of the Married Women's Property Committee. She had strong religious and ethical beliefs on which she also wrote. For some years she was also joint secretary of the National Anti-vivisection Society and was a founding member of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection. She visited Italy frequently and spent several seasons at places such as Rome and Florence. She died in 1904. Louisa Maria Hubbard (1836-1906), promoter of employment for women and journal editor, was born in St Petersburg in 1836, the eldest daughter of an English merchant, William Egerton Hubbard, who returned to Britain in 1843. The family lived in Leonardslee near Horsham, Sussex, where she was educated at home. She began her public life in the 'deaconess movement', an organisation she supported between 1864-1874. From 1869, Louisa was editor of the 'Englishwoman's Yearbook'. This publication provided a list of all the institutions and societies which existed for the benefit of women and children. In 1873, Louisa was responsible for establishing Bishop Otter College in Chichester. It was a training college for ladies wishing to work as elementary teachers. In 1875 Louisa founded the 'Woman's Gazette'. This paper became known as 'Work and Leisure' from Jan 1880. She was the editor of these papers from 1875-1893. From 1884-1885, she was involved with the United Englishwoman's Emigration Association whose aim was to emigrate women of good character, to ensure their safety during and after their travel and to keep in touch with them for some time after their arrival. In Nov 1885, Ellen Joyce and Mrs Adelaide Ross replaced Louisa Hubbard at the head of the organisation. She was also involved with the United British Women's Emigration Association. Louisa Hubbard died 25 Nov 1906. Emily Faithfull (1835-1895) was the youngest child of Reverend Ferdinand Faithfull, rector of Headley in Surrey, and his wife, Elizabeth Mary, on 27 May 1835. She was educated both at home in Headley, Surrey and at a boarding school in Kensington, from the age of 13 before being presented at court in 1857, aged 21. She was a member of the Langham Place Group. Emily had a keen interest in women's employment that later led her to write and give lectures on the subject. In 1859 she was a co-founder of the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women, together with Jessie Boucherett, Barbara Bodichon and Bessie Rayner Parkes. Emily also served as secretary to the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science's Committee in Nov 1859. Bessie Rayner Parkes was also a member of this committee and it was she who introduced Emily to the printing press. Emily founded her own printing house, The Victoria Press, in Mar 1860. It was a printing office for women typesetters, housed in Great Coram Street, later in Farringdon Street and then Praed Street, London. Emily being appointed Printer and Publisher in Ordinary to Her Majesty in 1862 acknowledged its success. From 1863 to 1880 she published and edited the 'Victoria Magazine' that became a voice for those championing women's employment. In 1864, due to her close friendship with his wife, Helen Jane, she was involved in the public scandal of the divorce case of Admiral (Sir) Henry Codrington that affected her public reputation. Emily became one of the first women to join the Women's Trade Union League, founded in 1875 by Emma Paterson. She also served as Treasurer to a girls' club in Lamb's Conduit Street in Bloomsbury and on moving to Manchester, ran the local branch of the Colonial Emigration Society. In 1872 Emily made her first visit to the United States where her talks were well received, she re-visited in 1882 and 1883-4 and produced a book entitled 'Three Visits to America' (Edinburgh, 1884) which compared the movements for women's work in England and America. She also published two novels. In 1874 Emily was involved in establishing the Women's Printing Society and a few years later, in founding 1877, the 'West London Express', which unfortunately only lasted eighteen months. Emily was on also the staff of the 'London Pictorial'. Ownership of 'The Victoria Press' was transferred to the Queen Printing and Publishing Company in Apr 1881. In the same year Emily helped found the International Musical, Dramatic and Literary Association, which was concerned with securing better protection through copyright. Emily was fortunate to receive \u00a3100 from the royal bounty in 1886 and from 1889 received an annual civil-list pension of \u00a350. After suffering for many years with asthma and bronchitis, Emily died 31 May 1895 in Manchester aged sixty. Millicent Garrett Fawcett (1847-1929) was born in Suffolk in 1847, the daughter of Newson and Louisa Garrett and the sister of Samuel Garrett, Agnes Garrett, Louise Smith and Elizabeth Garrett Anderson. The sisters' early interest in the issue of women's suffrage and commitment to the Liberal party were heightened after attending a speech given in London by John Stuart Mill in Jul 1865. Though considered too young to sign the petition in favour of votes for women, which was presented to the House of Commons in 1866, Millicent attended the debate on the issue in May 1867. This occurred a month after she married the professor of political economy and radical Liberal MP for Brighton, Henry Fawcett. Throughout their marriage, the future cabinet minister supported his wife's activities while she acted as his secretary due to his blindness. Their only child, Philippa Fawcett, was born the following year and that same month Millicent Garrett Fawcett published her first article, on the education of women. In Jul 1867, Millicent Garrett Fawcett was asked to join the executive committee of the London National Society for Women's Suffrage and was one of the speakers at its first public meeting two years later. She continued her work with the London National Society until after the death of John Stuart Mill in 1874, when she left the organisation to work with the Central Committee for Women's Suffrage. This was a step which she had avoided taking when the latter was formed in 1871 due to its public identification with the campaign for the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. Fawcett, despite her support for the movement's actions, had initially believed that the suffrage movement might be damaged by identification with such controversial work. However, the two groups later merged in 1877 as the new Central Committee for Women's Suffrage and a new executive committee was formed which included Fawcett herself. Her influence helped guide the group towards support for moderate policies and methods. She did little public speaking during this period but after the death of her husband in 1884 and a subsequent period of depression, she was persuaded to become a touring speaker once more in 1886 and began to devote her time to the work of the women's suffrage movement. In addition to women's suffrage Millicent Garrett Fawcett also became involved in the newly created National Vigilance Association, established in 1885, alongside campaigners such as J Stansfeld MP, Mr WT Stead, Mrs Mitchell, and Josephine Butler. In 1894 Fawcett's interest in public morality led her to vigorously campaign against the candidature of Henry Cust as Conservative MP for North Manchester. Cust, who had been known to have had several affairs, had seduced a young woman. Despite marrying Cust's marriage in 1893, after pressure from Balfour, Fawcett felt Cust was unfit for public office. Fawcett's campaign persisted until Cust's resignation in 1895, with some suffrage supporters concerned by Fawcett's doggedness in what they felt was a divisive campaign. In the late nineteenth century, the women's suffrage movement was closely identified with the Liberal Party through its traditional support for their work and the affiliation of many workers such as Fawcett herself. However, the party was, at this time, split over the issue of Home Rule for Ireland. Fawcett herself left the party to become a Liberal Unionist and helped lead the Women's Liberal Unionist Association. When it was proposed that the Central Committee's constitution should be changed to allow political organisations, and principally the Women's Liberal Federation, to affiliate, Fawcett opposed this and became the Honorary Treasurer when the majority of members left to form the Central National Society for Women's Suffrage. However, in 1893 she became one of the leading members of the Special Appeal Committee that was formed to repair the divisions in the movement. On the 19 Oct 1896 she was asked to preside over the joint meetings of the suffrage societies, which resulted in the geographical division of the country and the formation of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. She was appointed as the honorary secretary of the Central and Eastern Society that year and became a member of the parliamentary committee of the NUWSS itself. It was not until the parent group's reorganisation in 1907 that she was elected president of the National Union, a position that she would retain until 1919. By 1901, she was already eminent enough to be one of the first women appointed to sit on a Commission of Inquiry into the concentration camps created for Boer civilians by the British during the Boer War. Despite this, her work for suffrage never slackened and she was one of the leaders of the Mud March held in Feb 1907 as well as of the NUWSS procession from Embankment to the Albert Hall in Jun 1908. She became one of the Fighting Fund Committee in 1912 and managed the aftermath of the introduction of the policy, in particular during the North West Durham by-election in 1914, when other members opposed a step that effectively meant supporting the Labour Party when an anti-suffrage Liberal candidate was standing in a constituency. When the First World War broke out in Aug 1914, Fawcett called for the suspension of the NUWSS' political work and a change in activities to facilitate war work. This stance led to divisions in the organisation. The majority of its officers and ten of the executive committee resigned when she vetoed their attendance of a Women's Peace Congress in the Hague in 1915. However, she retained her position in the group. During the war, she also found time to become involved in the issue of women's social, political and educational status in India, an area in which she had become interested through her husband and retained after the conflict came to an end. She remained at the head of the NUWSS when the women's suffrage clause was added to the Representation of the People Act in 1918 and attended the Women's Peace Conference in Paris before lobbying the governments assembled there for the Peace Conference in 1919. She retired in Mar 1919 when the NUWSS became the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship but remained on its executive committee. She also continued her activities as the vice-president of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, to which she had been elected in 1902, for another year. After this she became the Chair of the journal, the 'Women's Leader', and appointed a Dame of the British Empire in 1925. It was in that year that she resigned from both NUSEC and the newspaper's board after opposing the organisation's policy in support of family allowances. She remained active until the end of her life, undertaking a trip to the Far East with her sister Agnes only a short time before her death in 1929. Corporate Histories: The Female Middle Class Emigration Society (1862-1908) was founded in 1862. The population explosion in England during the first half of the nineteenth century led government policy to encourage large scale emigration, while simultaneous concerns over the number of 'superfluous', unmarried women led to projects to stimulate female emigration. At the Social Sciences conference of 1860, Bessie Parkes advocated emigration as a solution to the population. This was also the belief and advice of Miss Maria S Rye after her experiences in the Society for Promoting Employment of Women, when she was deluged with applicants for a limited number of posts. She herself helped twenty-two women emigrate before attending the 1861 Social Sciences conference, when she appealed for help in establishing a new society to these ends. The Female Middle Class Emigration Society (FMCES) was therefore founded in May 1862 at 12 Portugal Street by a group which included Maria Rye, Jane E. Lewin, Emily Faithfull and Elizabeth (Bessie) Rayner Parkes, with the fund-raising assistance of Barbara Bodichon and with Lord Shaftsbury as its first president. Its stated aims were to assist middle class women who did not benefit from the government sponsorship for which working class women were eligible. Financed by public subscription and private donation, the society aimed to provide interest-free loans to enable educated women to emigrate. In addition, it established contacts at both departure and arrival points (mainly colonial ports). The first party, which included Maria Rye, was sent out to New Zealand in the autumn of 1862. At this point, Jane Lewin took over as Secretary, running the organisation from Sep 1862. Difficulties arose when it became clear that employers wanted working class domestics rather than middle-class governess and Rye, on her return in 1865, left to work with the emigrating working class with a particular interest in children's emigration. Lewin continued to concentrate on recruiting educators. In 1872, a further appeal for financial help was issued as the restricted funds which the society had at its disposal were limiting the number of emigrants being sent abroad. Lewin retired as secretary in 1881 to be replaced by Miss Strongitharm. The Female Middle Class Emigration Society was never a wealthy organisation and from 1884 to 1886 the funds were administered by the Colonial Emigration Society (CES) under Miss Julia Blake, its Secretary. The FMES was officially absorbed into the CES in 1886. In 1892 arrangements were made for the United British Women's Emigration Association to administer the loan fund. In 1908 Miss Lewin retired, and the Female Middle Class Emigration Society's later history is bound up with the British Women's Emigration Association. The National Vigilance Association (1885-1953) was founded at a time when the debate over the Contagious Diseases Acts and the regulation of prostitution had drawn public attention to the more general issue of the traffic of women and children. Investigations into child prostitution by WT Stead published in the Pall Mall Gazette increased pressure to pass a Criminal Law Amendment Bill. In order to achieve this immediate aim and support any future changes to the law deemed necessary, the National Vigilance Association was formed in Aug 1885 'for the enforcement and improvement of the laws for the repression of criminal vice and public immorality'. All local Vigilance Committees, and any other organisations with congruent aims, were to affiliate to this new body while in turn the central body was to stimulate the formation of new vigilance committees. The General Council consisted of delegates from the affiliated groups and other appointed members and early members included Mrs Fawcett, Mrs Percy Bunting, J Stansfeld MP, Mr WT Stead, Miss Ellice Hopkins, Mrs Mitchell, Mrs Lynch, Miss Bewicke, Mrs Bradley and Mrs Josephine Butler. At the initial meeting, an Executive Committee was appointed to manage the organisation's business and subcommittees were set up to deal with preventive, legal, organisational, parliamentary and municipal matters, as well as with registries, enquiries, the suppression of foreign traffic, finance and literature. The group grew rapidly at a local level and soon there were five branches of the association organised at a regional level: South Wales and Monmouthshire, Sunderland and North Eastern, Manchester and Northern Counties, Birmingham and Midland Counties and Bristol and South Western Counties. The new Association soon amalgamated with a number of other organisations working in the same field. The Minors' Protection Society merged with them in 1885, as did the Society for the Suppression of Vice, with the National Vigilance Association taking over responsibility for the work of the Belgian Traffic Committee. Discussions on a merger took place with the Central Vigilance Society from 1887 to 1891. The Association's activities also widened during this period. In 1899 the National Vigilance Association founded an international organisation, the International Bureau for the Suppression of Traffic in Persons. The Executive of the National Vigilance Association acted as the national committee for Britain within the framework of the International Bureau and in this context was known as the British National Committee though the personnel were identical at the time. Later, however, the British National Committee took on an extended role and became a separate, more broadly-based organisation in its own right which comprised representatives of all the major and some minor organisations for the protection of women and children. Subsequently, in 1917 the aims of the National Vigilance Association itself broadened once more to embrace the protection of women, minors (including young men) and children. To achieve this, they worked not only for the suppression of prostitution but also of 'obscene' publications and public behaviour. A Special Council was established concerned with 'the Suppression of the White Slave Traffic'. However, in the 1920s and 1930s the National Vigilance Association was constantly plagued with financial difficulties despite its merger with the Travellers' Aid Society in 1939. Rising costs and a diminishing income brought a financial crisis in 1951. In 1952 National Vigilance Association and British National Committee amalgamated once more, ending both their independent existences. Consequently, a new group emerged in 1953 which was named as the British Vigilance Association.",

the Granthams firmly believed that the family originated in Lincolnshire, the George Grantham who wrote in the family bible 'here went George Grantham to Lewes 18 March 1702' had previously baptised two sons at Horsham, in 1687 and 1689 (ACC 4789/1). George Grantham, the younger of those two sons, became a prosperous tradesman in Lewes; his great-grandson George Grantham (1782-1849), a coal-merchant, purchased a country house at Barcombe in 1839 and built up an extensive landed estate; and his son, Sir William Grantham (1835-1911), became a High Court judge, and his son William Wilson Grantham (1866-1942) the promoter of the revival of stoolball (a traditional Sussex game akin to rounders) and of the Sussex smock. In about 1730 George Grantham (1688-1765) was one of eight tenants of a house on the south side of Lewes High Street between St Andrews and Watergate Lanes sold by John Spence to Thomas Pelham (DL/D145/22 (4)). He was in trade as a basket-maker in 1734, when his vote, for the two Pelham candidates, was unsuccessfully challenged (LEW C/5/3/5). George served as headborough of Lewes in 1741 and constable in 1748. He married Mary Hards, and was probably the first of the family to be established at 59 High Street; according to Walter Godfrey, he lived there, as tenant to Henry Pelham, from 1744 to his death in 1765 (SAC 93). His son George Grantham (1726-1776) married Ann Douglas at Brighton on 24 August 1745, and their son George Grantham (1749-1836) also traded as a basket-makers, although the son diversified the business and traded as a wood-turner at both Lewes and Brighton; to him can probably be attributed the bill-head, advertising him as a turner, basket, chair and sieve maker, selling 'every article of hollow and round turnery and Tunbridge Ware, matting, floor cloths, corn shovels and measures, bottles, corks, combs, pails, mops, brooms brushes etc' (Brent, Georgian Lewes, 40). George was born on 7 December 1749 and married Ann Tutt (buried at St Michael Lewes on 26 August 1834), the daughter of Stephen Tutt, on 25 August 1782. He died in April 1836 and was buried at St Michael Lewes on 24 April. George Grantham (1782-1849), the son of George Grantham of Lewes (1749-1836) and his wife Ann Tutt, was born on 20 September 1782. He further diversified the family business into the coal trade, and by 1810 had turned their thriving ozier plots below St John sub Castro church into a coal and timber wharf. He was commissioned into the Militia in 1810 (see ACC 6077/18/5) and served as quartermaster 1811-1813 (SAS/WG 877-879). At Southover on 30 May 1829 he married Sarah Verrall (who died on 27 November 1871), the daughter of William Verrall of Southover, brewer. It was this George Grantham who transformed his family from urban tradesmen into country gentlemen. In 1829 he purchased Hammonds and Godwins Farm in Lindfield, and continued to acquire property in that parish and in Chailey throughout the 1830s. In 1839 he purchased Barcombe Place from John Holroyd, a London plumber holding a royal warrant, whose debts and those of his son had forced the sale of the property. He died on 23 October 1849 and was buried at Barcombe on 29 October. Of George Grantham's siblings, Edward (1798-1881) traded as an ironmonger, and Stephen (1783-1857), a noted breeder of Southdown sheep at Lower Stoneham in South Malling, also acted as land-steward to the Earl of Liverpool between 1816 and 1846 (GRA 16/1). George Grantham (1830-1880), the son of George Grantham of Barcombe Place (1782-1849) and his wife Sarah Verrall, was born on 11 April 1830 and baptised at St Michael Lewes on 9 May 1830. He left Barcombe Place on the death of his father in 1849 and went to Brighton to continue his education and that of his younger brother William. He returned to take possession of the family home in 1864 but sustained concussion of brain when thrown from horse. He initially recovered, but ten years later became subject to epileptic fits. 'Ever a staunch advocate of Conservative principles, he was always ready to come to the front when his services were required. He was one of those who urged on having a second candidate for East Sussex in 1868, when there seemed some hesitation on the point; and at the close of the election it was very clear that the second seat was lost only because too many had thought it impossible to win it.' (Sussex Express). George Grantham greatly extended the estate in Barcombe, and drove the family further in the direction of gentility by the acquisition of the lordships of the manor of Camois Court in 1866. But the more established gentry of Barcombe found him tiresome. On 28 February 1878, during the protracted negotiations over the siting of a new church at Spithurst, James Slater of Newick Park wrote to Sir John Dodson of Coneyboro: 'when I saw Grantham drive up yesterday I hoped to interpose a wide spreading thorn bush to escape his notice, but he found me out and descending, Ulster, beard, black bag and slouched hat complete, he fairly caught me. I suggested a conference in the hot house, but adroitly turning into a cool vinery he gave me more than an hour of unfinished sentences and shaky statements from amongst the flower pots.' His brother Sir William Grantham was born on 23 October 1835 and baptised at St Michael Lewes on 22 November 1835. He was educated at King's College School, London, entered the Inner Temple on 30 April 1860 and was called to the Bar on 26 January 1863. William served on the South Eastern Circuit and was appointed Queen's Counsel on 13 February 1877 and as a bencher of his inn on 30 April 1878. His pleasant manner, combined with pertinacity and great industry, soon secured him a steady practice. He obtained the reputation of being 'a very useful junior in an action on a builder's account, in a running-down case, in a compensation case, and especially in disputes in which a combined knowledge of law and horseflesh was desirable' (ODNB). He was appointed as a judge of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court in January 1886 (which post he held until 1911) and was knighted; he served as a JP for Sussex and as chairman of the East Sussex bench. As a high court judge, 'Grantham showed himself indefatigable and painstaking, and he never failed to clear his list on circuit. He was shrewd in his judgement of character, had a varied assortment of general knowledge, and his direct style made a favourable impression on juries. He had a competent knowledge of law for the ordinary work of nisi prius, and his industry and energy made a strong contrast to the methods of some of his colleagues. He lacked the breadth of mind and the grasp of intellect necessary for trying complicated issues, however, and he was an unsatisfactory judge in commercial cases. Among his failings was an inability to refrain from perpetual comment; his 'obiter dicta' brought him into collision at one time or another with nearly every class of the community - deans, publicans, chairmen of quarter sessions, the council of the bar, the Durham pitmen, his brother judges. His love of talking was not conducive to the dignity of the bench, and towards the close of his career he was given strong hints in the press that the public interest would be best served by his retirement. Grantham's name would not have been known to posterity had he not in the spring of 1906 found himself on the rota of judges appointed to try election petitions. It was a task for which his strong and somewhat intemperate political views rendered him peculiarly unsuited. His decisions at Bodmin, at Maidstone, and at Great Yarmouth, all of which favoured the Conservative claims to the seats, caused much dissatisfaction. On 6 July 1906 a motion to take into consideration his proceedings at Yarmouth was introduced into the House of Commons... Grantham felt the stigma deeply, but was unwise enough to revive the memory of the debate, some five years later, by an indiscreet speech to the grand jury at Liverpool (7 February 1911), which brought him a severe rebuke in the House of Commons from the prime minister, H. H. Asquith, one of the severest ever dealt to an English judge by a minister of the crown (Hansard 5, 22, 1911, 366). Yet, despite dicta to the contrary, Grantham was no doubt sincere in his belief that in the discharge of his office he was uninfluenced by political partiality. As Arthur Balfour put it in the course of the 1906 debate: 'a more transparently natural candid man than Mr Justice Grantham never exercised judicial functions' (ODNB). William Grantham sat as MP for East Surrey, 1874-1885 and for the borough of Croydon, 1885-1886. 'In parliament he was a fairly frequent speaker, who saw himself as having a special mission to unmask and defeat the machinations of Gladstone; he was conspicuous among the militant spirits on the Conservative benches' (ODNB). On 15 February 1865 he married Emma Wilson (died 21 November 1933) daughter and co-heir of Richard Wilson of Chiddingly and Molesworth House, Brighton (formerly of Westmoreland). In about 1900 he purchased the lordship of the manor of Balneath. He died from pneumonia at 100 Eaton Square, London on 30 November 1911 and was buried at Barcombe. His elder son William Wilson Grantham (1866-1942) of Balneath Manor, 17 Cadogan Place and 6 Crown Office Row was born on 7 January 1866 at South Norwood, Surrey. He was educated at Harrow and on 23 May 1884 he was admitted as a pensioner to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was awarded a BA in 1889 and an MA in 1895. William was admitted to the Inner Temple on 21 November 1884 and was called to the Bar on 27 January 1890; he served on the South Eastern Circuit and sat as Recorder of Deal, 1905-1942, as a JP for Sussex from 1919, and was appointed King's Counsel in 1923. He was the military representative on the Appeal Tribunal for East Sussex, 1914-1918. He served as master of the Grocers' Company 1906-07, represented the City on the London County Council, 1913-1942 and was its deputy chairman in 1935. Grantham served as an honorary captain in the army in 1900, and an honorary major in the 14th Middlesex (Inns of Court) Volunteers. He served in the First World War as Major of 6th (Cyclist) Battalion of the Sussex Regiment, and in 1935 remembered his intense disappointment when the War Office cancelled orders for the Unit's active service. On 17 July 1897 at Holy Trinity, Sloane Street, Chelsea he married Sybil de la Rue (born 21 Dec 1877), the daughter of Thomas Andros de la Rue of 8 Upper Wimpole Street, Cadogan Square, Chelsea, bt (b 1849) and his wife Emily Maria Speed (b 1848). He was immensely interested in the game of stoolball, had a collection of stoolball bats and was the author of Stool-ball Illustrated and How to Play it (London, 1931); he also attempted to re-introduce the wearing of 'traditional' Sussex smocks, and wore one himself on all but formal occasions. His role in the Sussex of the inter-war years, participation in the Society of Sussex Downsmen and general eccentricies are discusssed by John Lowerson, 'Stoolball', in SAC 133 (1995) 263-74. In 1935 a biography, in the series 'Modern South Saxons', appeared in the Sussex County Magazine, which bore a portait photograph of Grantham on the cover. As well as stoolball, the piece drew attention to his diaries (for which see ACC 4789), which 'throw light upon his many exciting experiences during his travels in Siberia, Mexico, and other parts of the world. He has entertained a good deal at Balneath Manor and visitors from the East have been his guests. It has always been his desire to bring about the friendly understanding between East and West.' Lowerson's portrait is less generous, suggesting that stoolball 'was increasingly shrouded in a patriotic pseudo-ruralism of which Grantham became a virtual caricature. Because of his actions stoolball came to typify a mildly dotty Englishness rooted in a near-mythical Sussex.' Grantham died on 18 February 1942. (See Sussex in the twentieth century (Brighton 1910) 334, 226; Sussex County Magazine 9 (July 1935) 398 and cover photograph). His son William Ivor Grantham (1898-1986) was born on 14 May 1898. He was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge where he gained an MA and LLB. He served in the Royal Sussex Regiment (Territorials) 1915-19 and was wounded in action. Called to the bar from the Inner Temple in 1922, he practised on South Eastern Circuit, and was commissioned in the Legal Branch of the RAF in 1931, rising to the rank of Squadron Leader. He was appointed deputy judge advocate general for the Middle East, Iraq and Aden (Army and RAF) from 1934, with headquarters in Cairo. On 27 May 1933 he married Helen Walker, daughter of Murray Walker of The Wilderness, Woodbridge, Suffolk. He sold Barcombe Place and 811 acres of its estate to Ernest William Smith Bartlett in February 1944, and lived at Massetts, Scaynes Hill. In 1961 he moved from to a new house at Camoys, Rotten Row, Lewes, and died in November 1986. The estate descended to his niece Mrs Sheila Thomson, who sold the lordships of the manors of Balneath, Camois Court and Twineham Benfield in 1995 (see ACC 7633/37-38).",

        "Description": "The collection consists primarily of paper grant and administrative files. Additional formats include bound volumes, parchment deeds, born digital records and photographic prints.\nAdministrative history: Overview The Cadbury Trusts collection consists of the administrative and operational records of eight interrelated charitable organisations, the Barrow and Geraldine S. Cadbury Trust, the Barrow Cadbury Fund, the Paul S. Cadbury Trust, the Barrow Cadbury Fund Ltd., the Southfield Trust, the Worgan Trust, Chapmans Hill School Farm Ltd. and the Barrow Cadbury Trust. Of the eight, the Barrow Cadbury Trust and the Barrow Cadbury Fund Ltd. continue (as of 2014) to operate from premises in London while the Worgan Trust carries out its now independent functions from Worcestershire. The other five organisations have either wound up their activities or merged to form the current Barrow Cadbury Trust. The records of other independent Cadbury family trusts are not included in this collection. Shared family governance, a steadfast commitment to Quaker principles and a connection to Birmingham and the Black Country underpin the historic and contemporary work of the Cadbury Trusts. The trusts have traditionally been managed by the Cadbury family, and, with few exceptions, trustees and directors have been drawn from the descendants of the founders Barrow and Geraldine S. Cadbury and their son Paul. The newest generation of family trustees are Barrow and Geraldine's great, great grandchildren. In recent years non-family trustees possessing specialist knowledge and skills have been invited to augment the family led board of the Barrow Cadbury Trust and the Fund. Three figures dominate the history of the Cadbury Trusts: Barrow Cadbury, Geraldine Southall Cadbury and Paul Strangman Cadbury. It was Barrow and Geraldine who decided to establish a trust bearing their name in 1920 as a formal extension of their considerable private charitable giving. Four years later they created the Barrow Cadbury Fund as a benevolent fund to allow them to expand the scope of their giving to include causes not considered as charitable or potentially not considered as charitable. In 1952 the Fund was wound up and its functions transferred to a new charitable company, the Barrow Cadbury Fund Ltd. Barrow and Geraldine's son Paul and his wife Rachel established their own charity, the Paul S. Cadbury Trust in 1931. By 1958 Paul was chairman of this trust in addition to the trust and fund established by his parents. In 1967 Paul founded the Worgan Trust to purchase land for amenity purposes and later, in 1972, Chapmans Hill School Farm Ltd. to operate a demonstration farm for school children near Waseley Hills Country Park in Worcestershire. Additionally, Paul oversaw the work of his children Catherine Hickinbotham, Edward Cadbury, Charles Cadbury and Philippa Southall who served as trustees of the Southfield Trust, established in 1966 to administer the Southfield hostel for ex-borstal boys in north London. In 1994 the Southfield Trust was dissolved and the Barrow and Geraldine S. Cadbury Trust and the Paul S. Cadbury Trust were merged under the joint Chairmanship of Charles Cadbury to form the new Barrow Cadbury Trust. The Trust and the allied Barrow Cadbury Fund Ltd. moved offices from College Walk in Birmingham to London during 2003. This move corresponded with the separation of Worgan Trust and Chapmans Hill School Farm Ltd. activities from those of the Trust and Fund. The Cadbury Trusts' have supported a great variety of individuals and organisations since 1920. Early giving tended to take the form of subscriptions and donations to traditional Friends organisations, local meeting houses and institutions promoting social welfare in the absence of the welfare state. Temperance, penal reform, education, town planning, medical research and the promotion of international peace all feature as prominent areas of charitable activity for the trusts. In penal reform the focus was particularly forward thinking with Geraldine Cadbury promoting structural changes at the national policy level. By the 1960s Paul Cadbury was eager to transform the Cadbury Trusts into an innovative grant making institution capable of supporting new ideas and ways of working. Subscriptions and small personal grants were pruned in order to focus resources on a smaller number of large-scale projects. To enable this transition to grant making Paul began to recruit professional staff to administer the trusts. Kenneth Nicholson was appointed in 1968 and, following his death, was succeeded by Anthony Wilson in 1969. Anthony was in turn joined by Assistant Secretary Eric Adams in 1972. Paul's decision to employ trained administrators at the Cadbury Trusts was a highly unusual one that was soon to bear fruit. These positions had hitherto been the province of retired military officers, diplomats and senior civil servants. The success of the Cadbury chocolate brand during the 20th century led to the accumulation of considerable personal wealth by the Cadbury family. Barrow and Paul both served as chairmen of Cadbury Brothers Ltd. and regularly reinvested the profits of the Company into their charitable trusts. This pattern of reinvestment increased the endowment of the trusts and allowed for increased charitable expenditure. The value of Trust investments rose considerably as a result of the 1969 merger between Cadbury and Schweppes. This event, coupled with the appointment of professional staff, allowed the trusts to become involved in a range of new projects and areas of work at a local, national and international level. While project oriented grant expenditure increased steadily from the 1970s onward it did not entirely displace subscriptions, donations and small personal grants at the Cadbury Trusts. Nevertheless the transition to grant making was largely a successful one. New grants were made to Black self-help groups in Handsworth, to employment initiatives in deprived areas of Birmingham and to community organising projects in the West Midlands and rural Northern Ireland. The trusts were also involved in the peace accords that ended the First Sudanese Civil War in 1972 and in promoting the rights of asylum seekers in the United Kingdom. There is a direct link between the work of Geraldine Cadbury with young offenders and the Barrow Cadbury Trust's support for the Transition to Adulthood Alliance in the 21st century. The Cadbury Trusts' have worked in a variety of different funding areas since their inception. Though portfolios of work vary over time they reflect the unfailing Quaker desire to improve the world through a commitment to human rights, peace, social justice, community life and freedom of conscience. It was the wish of the trusts' Quaker founders that their successors enjoy the freedom to address these concerns in a manner appropriate to the day. The deeds of trust establishing the Barrow and Geraldine S. Cadbury Trust and the Paul S. Cadbury Trust were left intentionally open ended in relation to defining acceptable categories of charitable giving. Thus, while Barrow and Geraldine may not have identified the rights of asylum seekers as an issue of their day, current Trust work in this field represents a logical extension of the Quaker interest in human rights and social justice. More familiar to the founders would be work in criminal justice and penal reform, a field that was viewed with as great a concern in 1920 as 2014. The Trusts' base in London has proven useful in exercising the Friends' maxim to 'speak truth to power'. Though the move from Birmingham was met with some trepidation by local grantees the Trust and Fund concluded that facilitating policy change at the national level would provide benefits not just to Birmingham and the Black Country but to the United Kingdom as a whole. While most local projects continue to be carried out in and around Birmingham these are intended to promote national level policy change and to shape public opinion. Barrow and Geraldine Cadbury Barrow Cadbury was born in Edgbaston, Birmingham on 27 September 1862 to prominent Birmingham Quakers Richard and Elizabeth Cadbury. He was named after his grandmother, Candia Barrow and was the elder brother of William Adlington Cadbury, born on 17 February 1867. At the time of his birth Barrow's father and uncle George were managing the family tea, coffee and chocolate shop established by John Cadbury in 1824. Despite improvements in chocolate purity and advertising, the business, Cadbury Brothers, was in financial difficulty. It took the advent of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 and the subsequent collapse of the once dominant French chocolate industry to radically alter the fortunes of the firm. Lacking a continental supplier, British consumers increasingly turned to Cadbury Brothers for their chocolate requirements during the 1870s. These market successes led to the opening of a new factory along the Bourn Brook in rural Worcestershire near Kings Norton in 1879. The name of the new factory community was Bournville, the ville conveying a certain continental flourish. The works grew steadily throughout the late 19th century into a thriving model village where the needs of the workers were met by the profits of the business. Together, Richard and George built a self-contained community based on Quaker principles. Bournville employees and local residents were provided with medical care, amenities, education, lodging and other forms of social security unheard of at the time. Alcohol, gambling and other vices were not permitted. In 1899 Barrow's father died and his uncle George transformed the business from a partnership into a private limited company. It was amidst the backdrop of waxing and waning family business fortunes that Barrow grew up. He attended Quaker schools in Birmingham and spent two years studying in Germany when he was eleven. This experience left him a fluent speaker of German. Barrow studied chemistry and mechanical drawing at Owens College in Manchester. With this training he was able to assist in the preparation of plans for new buildings at Bournville. With his academic course complete Barrow interned in London as an apprentice at C.M.&C. Woodhouse, a firm of colonial brokers that imported, among other raw materials, cocoa. In 1882 Barrow began his employment with Cadbury Brothers. He served in a number of different positions in the business to gain a well-rounded understanding of manufacturing processes and administration. At the time of his father's death in 1899 Barrow occupied a senior post in the Cashier's Department. With the creation of Cadbury Brothers Ltd. he became one of four directors serving under the Chairman, George Cadbury. In 1914 Barrow was appointed Vice Chair of Cadbury Brothers Ltd. and, following George's death in 1922, Chairman. He held this position until his retirement in 1932. That same year he was given the Honorary Freedom of the City of Birmingham. Barrow lived a long and healthy life, giving generously until his death in 1958 at the age of ninety five. Geraldine Southall was born on 29 June 1865 in Birmingham to Alfred Southall and Anna Strangman Southall (nee Grubb). The Southalls were a well-established Birmingham Quaker family. Geraldine's grandfather William owned a chemists shop on Bull Street. Her father Alfred followed in William's footsteps, training as a chemist and eventually taking on the family business. The Grubb family were also prominent Quakers though they had come to Birmingham more recently from southern Ireland. Anna was the president of the Friends' Reading Society in Birmingham, the first woman to serve in this post. She was also a trained botanist. Geraldine was the eldest of nine children. Like her mother she was well read and open minded. Her upbringing was Spartan but happy. She attended Edgbaston High School for Girls in 1880 and later spent a year at a Quaker boarding school in York. Geraldine returned to help look after her brothers and sisters when her mother's health began to decline. Both the Southall and the Cadbury families were members of the Bull Street Meeting in the centre of Birmingham. It was here that Geraldine and Barrow first met. The pair fell in love and became engaged in December 1890. They wed on 08 September 1891 and honeymooned in Switzerland. Barrow and Geraldine lived modestly, despite his rising fortunes at Cadbury Brothers and inheriting a substantial sum from his father. The couple were deeply concerned with the social ills afflicting Birmingham, particularly relating to poverty. Public attitudes toward the poor during the Victorian period tended to be punitive and severe. This view was not shared by the Cadbury and Southall families. Alfred Southall was engaged in the coffee house movement both as a temperance business venture and to combat public drunkenness, then a major problem in Birmingham. Richard Cadbury had been a major advocate of the adult school movement to teach men of poor circumstances how to read and write. Barrow followed his father's example and continued his engagement with adult schools. In addition to holding positions in the national organisation he taught at Moseley Road Institute and helped to establish Westhill Training Institute in 1907. The Cadburys were also regular supporters of the Society of Friends and helped to fund the construction of Friends House in London. Many donations were also made toward the upkeep of local meeting houses in the Midlands. Geraldine was deeply concerned about the health of poor urban children in Birmingham. She felt that an upbringing in slums left children particularly susceptible to disease and an array of social and developmental problems. Geraldine proposed to create an open air school for sickly children on family property situated near Uffculme House. Works began on Uffculme School in 1911 and were completed that same year. Small classes, hearty meals and exposure to fresh air combined to improve the health of most children admitted to the school. In 1922 another open air school, Cropwood, was donated to the City of Birmingham as a boarding school for sickly children. The site of the school had once been Geraldine and Barrow's holiday home. Another cause close to Geraldine's heart was the plight of 'delinquent' children. At the beginning of the 20th century no distinction was drawn between prison and court facilities for young offenders and adult offenders. Barrow and Geraldine were enthusiastic supporters of the Birmingham Children's Court established in 1905. Barrow and Geraldine's father Alfred were appointed magistrates of the court in 1906. Geraldine acted as an observer and de facto case officer for children brought before the court. She too was appointed magistrate in 1920 and later Chairman of the Juvenile Court Panel of Justices in 1923. To assist the business of the court the couple outfitted a remand home to house children with cases pending or cases awaiting decision. This facility allowed children to be kept apart from the adult offender population. The home, opened in 1909 featured class rooms, modern sanitary facilities, opportunities for play and large, airy bedrooms. In 1928 Barrow and Geraldine decided to outfit and donate a separate children's court to the city. This new court provided a less imposing environment for children and further segregated them from adult offenders who were hitherto tried in the same building as young offenders. In addition to working to improve conditions and outcomes for young offenders in Birmingham Geraldine was also involved in penal reform at the national level. In 1922 she was invited to join the Home Office Committee on Probation and in 1925 the Committee on the Treatment of Young Offenders. She lobbied for better trained probation officers, raising the age of criminal responsibility and ending corporal punishment. Her efforts met with some success and in 1933 the age of criminal responsibility was raised to eight (Geraldine had recommended fifteen) by the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. She was also effective in reducing the severity of sentencing for children through the preferential use of probation over incarceration in non-serious cases. In 1937 Geraldine was recognised by the King for her services to children and appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1938 she published a history of young offenders in England entitled 'Young Offenders Yesterday and Today'. Geraldine died in 1941 at the age of seventy-six. Barrow, who had been retired for almost a decade at the time of Geraldine's death, continued to pursue penal reform in England and Wales. In 1947 Forhill Observation Home was opened in Kings Norton to allow for the effective screening of young offenders for mental illness and other health conditions. Geraldine had been a keen advocate of establishing observation facilities in the UK following a tour of the State Observation Centre in Belgium in 1926. Barrow viewed Forhill as a tribute to Geraldine and the realisation of one of the many facets of her work in penal reform. Prior to the First World War Barrow and Geraldine worked to promote international peace and understanding through establishing closer ties between British and German churches. Barrow was appointed the treasurer of the Associated Councils of the Churches of the British and German Empires and formed part of the delegation to King Edward VII at the Seventeenth Universal Congress for Peace in 1908. When war came Barrow made considerable donations to the Friends Ambulance Unit and other Friends relief organisations. He visited parts of eastern France formerly occupied by the German Army and made recommendations to the Friends War Victims Relief Committee on how to improve conditions for civilians in the region. In Birmingham Geraldine was successful in organising accommodation for thousands of Belgian war refugees resettled in the Midlands. She even set up a maternity home to safeguard the health of Belgian mothers and their babies. Barrow and Geraldine gave freely of their personal wealth to charitable causes and to individuals in need. In 1920, after decades of substantial informal giving the couple established the Barrow and Geraldine S. Cadbury Trust as a formal channel for their philanthropic activities. The new trust was created partly in response to Joseph Rowntree's call for increased private charitable giving to accompany the greater investment in social welfare being pursued by Government following the First World War. The couple administered their trust and allied benevolent fund until their deaths at which time this responsibility passed to their children. Paul Cadbury Barrow and Geraldine had three children, Dorothy Adlington, Paul Strangman and Geraldine Mary, affectionately known as 'Cherry'. All three became involved in the philanthropic activities of their parent's trust though none more so than their second child Paul. Born in 1895 Paul attended school in Birmingham before spending a year at the country home, Cropwood, to improve his health. Fully recovered as a result of his open air cure, Paul attended Leighton Park School where he excelled academically and in school sports. Admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War. Paul volunteered to accompany a contingent of the Friends' War Victims Relief Fund to France in 1914. From this posting he joined the Friends Ambulance Unit where he served in a variety of roles during the course of the war. While in France Paul met his fianc\u00e9e Rachel Eveline Wilson who was then serving as a Unit nurse at Dunkirk. The couple married after the war on 24 June 1919 at the George Road Meeting House in Edgbaston. With the war over Paul joined Cadbury Brothers Ltd. where, after a year, he was appointed as a Managing Director alongside his sister Dorothy. Paul worked primarily in sales and marketing where he achieved remarkable success for the Company despite the poor national economic conditions prevalent during the 1930s. In 1921 Paul was appointed to the joint board governing Cadbury and Fry. He joined the Council of the Manufacturing Confectioners' Alliance in 1920, serving as president of the organisation for three terms. In 1948 he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to the Ministry of Food. In 1959, Paul's cousin Laurence stepped down as Chairman of Cadburys and Paul was appointed to manage the Company. He served as chairman until his retirement in 1965. Paul shared his father's interest in adult education and volunteered as a teacher at several adult schools after 1918. The couple also shared a concern for the welfare of children and the disabled. Paul and Rachel accrued many years of service on behalf of Middlemore Emigration Homes. In 1930 Rachel gave birth to a daughter, Margaret, who was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. This event led Paul to divert some of his considerable energies to medical research into the causes and treatment of the disease. Paul co-founded the Midlands Spastics' Association with Steven Quayle in 1947. He also helped to establish Carlson House School, the first educational institution catering to the needs of children with cerebral palsy, in 1948. Paul and Rachel were very active in the Society of Friends and generously supported Quaker causes and meetings. During the Second World War Paul led the effort to reform the Friends Ambulance Unit and deploy its medical staff to major theatres of the war. He also spoke on behalf of conscientious objectors at their tribunals. His interest in international peace took him to the Soviet Union in 1951 in the hope of promoting better understanding between east and west. Paul had a lifelong passion for town planning and community development. He was appointed a trustee of the Bournville Village Trust by his uncle George in 1922 and was an enthusiastic advocate of parks in Birmingham and preserving green belt land around the city. During the Second World War while serving on the Birmingham City Council he was appointed chairman of a post-war research and planning committee. He was later appointed Honorary Secretary of the West Midlands Group on Post-War Reconstruction. In 1957 Paul was invited to join the Royal Commission on Local Government in the Greater London Area and the Central Housing Advisory Committee. He published several books on post-war planning and local government and was regarded as an authority on the subject. Paul accumulated considerable wealth during his career at Cadburys. Like his father, he directed most of his personal fortune to charitable causes. This generosity was principally manifested through the Paul S. Cadbury Trust and the charitable trust and fund established by his parents. From 1958 until the end of his life Paul chaired the Cadbury Trusts. During his tenure an innovative and professional organisation emerged to carry forward the trusts' enduring commitment to a more just and equal society. Paul died on 07 October 1984. After Paul's death the leadership of the Cadbury Trusts passed to his daughters Catherine Hickinbotham and Philippa Southall. They were followed by their brother Charles Cadbury and then in turn by Paul's grandchildren Anna Southall, Ruth Cadbury and Helen Cadbury. A Quaker ethos The founders of the Cadbury Trusts' were greatly influenced by their Quaker beliefs. The Friends' have long established roots in Birmingham alongside other non-conformist denominations of Christianity. Many prominent Birmingham families, including Cadbury, Lloyd, Sturge, Humphrey, Wilson and Albright were members of the Society of Friends. These families have collectively exerted a great influence on the development of the city of Birmingham through their desire to improve the world and their success in business. Quakerism traces its origins to the 17th century and the teachings of George Fox. Fox advocated a personal relationship with God and the idea that the light of God is in everyone. These egalitarian beliefs were at odds both with the established church and the British class system and the Quakers were persecuted by enemies from church and state. The Toleration Act of 1689 improved the legal status of Quakers by acknowledging their right to religious worship. The Act did not alter the prohibition excluding Friends from attending university. This stricture, in force until the late 19th century, had the practical effect of barring Quakers from medicine, law and other professions. In response the community became more closely associated with business and banking and soon earned a reputation for honesty and integrity. The belief that God is in everyone has engendered a strong sense of fairness and equality in the Quaker community. This belief is expressed though a commitment to gender, racial, economic and social justice and the promotion of peace and human rights. The Friends were outspoken advocates for the abolition of slavery and women's suffrage. While Quakers oppose war and violence many have served as non-combatants in war relief organisations or medical units in conflict zones. Friends assiduously avoid conducting business with or investing in industries that profit from war. Success in business provided Friends with the financial resources necessary to realise their vision of a more just world. Through hard work and perspicacity the Rowntree and Cadbury families made a name for themselves as prosperous chocolate manufacturers. Both families in turn reinvested their profits into a group of charitable trusts whose work reflected the Quaker principles of their founders. Early giving by the Cadbury Trusts was directed towards organisations promoting penal reform, adult education, temperance and international peace: all well-established Friends causes. While the form and focus of charitable giving by the Cadbury Trusts is constantly evolving to meet the needs of the day, the underlying principles remain unchanged. In this way the ethos of the trusts transcends any political ideology, economic theory or cultural whim and remains true to the teachings and practice of the Society of Friends.\nArrangement: MS 1579/1 - Administrative records MS 1579/1/1 - Joint organisational records MS 1579/1/1/1 - Joint meetings and minutes MS 1579/1/1/1/1 - Joint trusts and Fund meetings MS 1579/1/1/1/2 - Staffing Trustee meetings MS 1579/1/1/1/3 - General Purpose Committee meetings MS 1579/1/1/1/4 - Asset Policy Group meetings MS 1579/1/1/1/5 - Annual strategic review meetings MS 1579/1/1/2 - Programme meetings and minutes MS 1579/1/1/2/1 - Joint programme meetings MS 1579/1/1/2/2 - Minority Arts Programme meetings MS 1579/1/1/2/3 - Racial Justice Programme meetings MS 1579/1/1/3 - Annual reports MS 1579/1/1/3/1 - Annual reports MS 1579/1/1/3/2 - Annual report correspondence MS 1579/1/1/4 - Monthly reviews MS 1579/1/1/5 - Financial correspondence MS 1579/1/1/6 - Office meetings and administration MS 1579/1/1/7 - Property records MS 1579/1/1/8 - Staff records MS 1579/1/1/9 - Trusts and foundations collaborative correspondence MS 1579/1/1/9/1 - National organisations correspondence MS 1579/1/1/9/2 - Regional organisations correspondence MS 1579/1/1/10 - Correspondence with Birmingham Archives and Heritage MS 1579/1/1/11 - Staff, trustee and event photographs MS 1579/1/1/12 - Articles and publications MS 1579/1/1/12/1 - Publications about the Trust, the Cadbury family and related subjects MS 1579/1/1/12/2 - Publications commissioned or supported by the Cadbury Trusts and Trust library material MS 1579/1/1/12/3 - Audio-visual material MS 1579/1/1/12/4 - Oral history interviews MS 1579/1/1/13 - Other policy records and correspondence MS 1579/1/2 - Barrow and Geraldine S.

        "Description": "THE ARCHIVES OF THE ASHBURNHAM FAMILY AND THEIR SUSSEX ESTATE The chief seat of the Ashburnham family was Ashburnham Place, near Battle, where, as we have seen, they had been settled from about the end of the 12th century until 1953. A family with such a continuous record of residence, owners of vast estates and of great wealth, naturally accumulated a large and heterogeneous quantity of archives; the classification of these documents has presented many problems and a certain amount of overlapping in several sections has been unavoidable. The main divisions into which the records have been placed will be found in the list of contents of this book on pp. ii, iii, and the general index has, it is hoped, brought scattered references together. Among those records deserving special mention are:-- PEDIGREES which include those of the Vaughan family brought in by the marriage in 1677 of Bridget Vaughan with John, 1st Baron Ashburnham. This lady also brought to the family the important Welsh estates of which the archives have been transferred to the National Library of Wales; a catalogue of them is available in the East Sussex Record Office FAMILY HONOURS. There are the richly decorated letters patent for the creation of John Ashburnham as Baron Ashburnham, 1689, and those for the advancement of his son as Earl of Ashburnham and Viscount St. Asaph, 1730. The archives also contain twelve papal and other briefs in respect of honours conferred on the 5th Earl for his work in connexion with Roman Catholicism and the attempt to restore Carlos VII to the Spanish throne APPOINTMENTS TO PUBLIC OR SEMI-PUBLIC OFFICES. Under this heading (pp. 3-5) is listed the finely painted roll of the Constables of Dover Castle and Lord Wardens of the Cinque Ports presented by John Philipot, Somerset Herald, to the ill-fated George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, in 1627. There are a few records relating to the offices of Keeper of the Great Wardrobe and Groom of the Stole, appointments of lieutenancy, and commissions in the army; the latter include that of John Ashburnham, the Cavalier, to be Captain of a Company of 150 Foot in the Earl of Northumberland's Regiment, 1640 MARRIAGE SETTLEMENTS AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTS. An extensive series dating from 1601, and of much value when dealing with the order in which certain estates came into the family's possession. The documents have been listed with some indication of the amount of detail they contain. WILLS AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTS. These cover the period 1670 to 1888. The earliest is that of John Ashburnham which refers to the former Sussex estates of the family and to the watch of Charles I CORRESPONDENCE. A relatively small section but important for the letter-books of the outgoing correspondence of John, 1st Baron Ashburnham, in 8 vols., 1696-1708 (See R. Gunnis, 'Letters if the First Lord Ashburnham', in Sussex Archaeological Collections, vol. 88, pp. 3-14.) Letters or transcripts of letters written by John and William Ashburnham are noted among the Addenda on p. 122. Many later letters are from persons of distinction, and if their names are included in the Dictionary of National Biography the fact is usually noted. One group (no. 929, p. 24) relates to the Colonna Raphael which was sold in 1896 for \u00a317,000. PERSONAL ACCOUNTS. Only two day-books, 1678-1681, 1710-1716, survive for the early period. Among the later accounts, those for miniatures painted by Robert Thorburn are of interest. HOUSEHOLD ACCOUNTS. These date from the opening years of the 19th century, and include wage and tradesmen's accounts, those kept by head servants, and the usual 'consumable stores' accounts common in most large establishments. There are very few vouchers. MISCELLANEOUS ACCOUNTS. A small group, 1812-1883 WINE AND BEER REGISTERS. A long run of wine cellar-books, 1824-1914, is included CHARITIES. Mainly concerning the distribution of food from Ashburnham Place, mid-19th century onwards. INVESTMENTS. The 5th Earl invested large sums in various projects; the papers listed refer mainly to the failure of these schemes. INVENTORIES. Except for an important inventory of jewels, plate, furnishings, etc. taken at the end of the 17th century, the inventories are of 19th century date. DIARIES, JOURNALS AND PAPERS RELATING TO FOREIGN TRAVEL. The travel journals and volumes of water-colour and other drawings (see pp. 32, 33) are valuable for the information they provide on conditions abroad in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The personal diaries (with the exception of the 3 vols. of the 1st Lord Ashburnham, 1686-7), although in quantity, are little better than memoranda books. PARLIAMENTARY. The Ashburnham family did not produce any great politicians. The petition of the inhabitants of New Shoreham protesting against the Bill for the Septennial Act, and the poll list for the Sussex election, 1734, are the principal items in this class THE CIVIL WAR AND THE RELICS OF CHARLES I. See pp. 34-36 and Plate III. The criticism levelled at John Ashburnham at the time of King Charles's arrest is answered by his vindication of which two manuscript copies are preserved. This narrative was published by the 4th Earl (see p. xv) with much other allied material, but the work is ill-balanced. Three original letters of Charles I are preserved among the archives, together with papers about the relics in the former custody of the Earls of Ashburnham (see also Ashburnham MS. 2800). A small group of letters from the 3rd Earl to W. Nicol who printed the Narrative came to the East Sussex Record Office from another source and is catalogued as Additional MS. 800. THE CARLIST ACTIVITIES OF THE 5TH EARL. An unusual collection of material from which a complete and vivid picture of the Earl's activities may be constructed. The group contains a wealth of correspondence (including letters written by Spanish refugees, 1819-1830) from many royal persons. A series of printed books and pamphlets, photographs, newspaper cuttings, etc. concerning Carlist and Catholic matters are also listed on pp. 36-39. ART. Includes a volume of sketches of Suffolk scenes, 1797, and a copper plate etched by the 4th Earl when a boy at Westminster School. LITERARY. A collection of manuscript and printed items of mixed character, including pamphlets written or published by the 4th and 5th Earls MISCELLANEOUS FAMILY PAPERS. A small group including a book recording the weights and heights of members of the Ashburnham family, 1835-1861 PAPERS RELATING TO THE BUILDING AND FURNISHING OF ASHBURNHAM PLACE AND OTHER RESIDENCES. (Illustrated articles on Ashburnham Place appeared in country Life, 22 and 29 January, 1916, and 16, 23 and 30 April, 1953; in Sussex county Magazine, vol. 27 (1953), pp. 566-575; in Hastings and East Sussex Naturalist, vol. 2 (1915). An article on the Churchill Club whose premises were the old Ashburnham House in Dean's Yard, Westminster, appeared in Country Life, 3 September 1943. Soon after the sale of the contents of Ashburnham Place in 1953, photographs of, and notes about,furniture, picture, silver and other items from Ashburnham Place began to appear in various art journals.) The more important drawings are those of Lancelot ('Capability') Brown (See D. Stroud, Capability Brown (1950), p. 129, and plates on pp. 84, 136, 137.) for improvements to the Park in the 18th century. There are detailed accounts of George Dance the younger for alterations made between 1812 and 1817 which are useful for costs of labour and materials. Extensive alterations were made to Ashburnham Place in the middle of 19th century, and a considerable quantity of letters, plans and drawings and other material has survived. There are smaller groups relating to the Dover Street, London, house (see pp. 41-51). THE ASHBURNHAM LIBRARY. The creation of a library by the 4th Earl which vied in the richness and diversity of its treasures with those of Sir Thomas Phillipps, and Robert (Curzon) 14th Lord Zouche at Parham, is documented in some detail in the Ashburnham archives. For the dispersal of the library by the 5th Earl, the papers are even more complete, and include correspondence which will be of exceptional interest to future bibliographers. The Stowe MSS., once at Ashburnham, are now in the British Museum, and a catalogue of them has been published. There are sundry printed and manuscript catalogues of the Ashburnham Library, and a few books and pamphlets--mostly incomplete or mutilated--which are undoubtedly a remnant of that celebrated collection G.E.C., Complete Peerage, vol. 1 (1910) TITLE DEEDS. Nearly 4,500 items are included under this heading for Sussex. Documents ranging in date between the late 12th and late 19th centuries are included in the following groups:-- A1--A313 which are loose deeds removed from Ashburnham Place and not fully calendared. Draft calendars and notes exist (Ashburnham MS. 118) for deeds A1-A73. B1-B1167 which were arranged in chronological order (13th century to 1836) and calendared by the late Rev. Walter Budgen. Mr. Budgen must have broken numerous original bundles thereby destroying much valuable evidence on the composition of the estate and its growth; his calendar is in one volume (no. 4449, and not indexed. Most of the documents were endorsed by Mr. Budgen in indelible pencil. There is evidence that some of these deeds have been in or near a fire as they are scorched and the seals have melted. L1-L2949 were received through Messrs. Peake & Co., the estate solicitors, London, and are arranged in original bundles under properties. Except for certain groups of early deeds, the documents are listed in a typed schedule (nos. 4450, 4451, and an index of properties, arranged by parishes, has been compiled. These archives are an exceptionally complete and important series despite the interference in the arrangement of the first two groups. MANORIAL DOCUMENTS. The records of twenty manors are included, ranging in date from 1418 to 1951. The majority of the court rolls date from the 17th century, and the number of documents varies considerably from manor to manor. The manors of Ashburnham, Burwash, Burghurst in Burwash, Cowden in Wartling, Dallington and Netherfield in Battle are among those with good runs of archives, and the six compotus rolls, 1418-1526, for the manors of Burghurst, Dallington, Shiplake, Bevilham in Mayfield and Bevilham-cum-Burghurst are of interest. Among the documents received from Messrs. Peake & Co. are court rolls and other manorial records relating to the manors of Wartling and Rockland, Falmer, Aldwick and Rockland and Boreham, 1408-1663 (L1596-L1600). The history of the Ashburnham manors may be found in the Victoria County History, Sussex, and similar books; although the appropriate references are given in the lists on pp. 57-65, much more detailed information about the manors could be gained from the documents themselves. The miscellaneous archives listed are chiefly stewards' fee books. The names used for the manors are as given in the Victoria County History, Sussex. PURCHASES AND SALES OF PROPERTY. This section should be read in conjunction with the schedules of deeds received from Messrs. Peake & Co. (see above, and p. 107). Most of the papers are letters, agreements, draft conveyances, schedules of properties, and sale particulars, 1787-1923. ESTATE CORRESPONDENCE. Large quantities of letters (1778-1918) from agents, solicitors and others concerned with the administration of the Ashburnham estates have survived. It would be impracticable to abstract this correspondence, but some indication of the writers and subjects is given in the lists on A certain amount of overlap with other sections is inevitable. RENTALS AND AUDIT ACCOUNTS. A volume, 1671-1710, is the chief item of interest, but the rentals of the Sussex estates, 1690-1836 (with some gaps) are important for a study of the value of the properties. This section (pp. 72-73) should be studied with the estate accounts referred to in the next paragraph. ESTATE ACCOUNTS. What has been termed 'Estate: General Accounts' is the largest series in the Ashburnham archives. There are 172 volumes (besides loose papers), 1679-1925, and these comprise the annual accounts analysed under subjects, and various day-books. The book-keeping system for the main accounts is simple to follow, but owing to lack of uniformity it is not always easy to determine where various subsidiary accounts fit into the system. Some of the volumes include expenditure on housekeeping, servants' wages, and the sale of stock and timber. FARM ACCOUNTS. So far as is possible, these have been separated from the general estate accounts; the period covered is 1821-1886. LABOUR ACCOUNTS. These cover much the same period as the farm accounts, and are a useful source of information on rates of wages and duties. IRON, LIME AND BRICK ACCOUNTS. The Ashburnham Iron Works survived longer than any in Sussex; the Ashburnham Furnace is, in fact, still part of the estate. (See also p. ix and Sussex Notes and Queries, vol. 2, pp. 67-8, vol. 6, p. 172, and vol. 12, p. 55; B. H. Lucas, 'The Ashburnham Iron Works', in Sussex County Magazine, vol. 7 (1933), pp. 81-5.) The annual accounts for the Orchard Wood and Forest Iron and Lime Works, 1789-1829, are in 29 bundles, and there are 39 vols. of general accounts; reference should also be made to the general estate accounts when using these records. The brick and tile accounts are late 19th century. TENANCY AGREEMENTS. A printed form of agreement was used on the Ashburnham estate, and the 239 counterparts which have survived 9. A few associated papers have also been included under this heading. MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTY. Excluding Ashburnham Place very few archives have survived under this heading. Further information is likely to be found in the estate correspondence CARTULARIES, TERRIERS, VALUATIONS, SURVEYS AND MAPS. Administration of the estate was facilitated by the documents in this group. The terriers or 'particulars' of lands commence in 1652. The most complete survey and valuation of the entire Sussex estate is one by Edward Driver in 1830 (no. 1173, A numerical terrier with reference to a volume of maps--not deposited--was made by Driver in 1834, and concerns 13,616 acres in 2,022 lots (no. 1174 The estate maps and plans dating from 1635 have been catalogued in detail and include some good examples of the cartographer's skill; among the surveyors may be mentioned Gyles Burton 'practitioner in some of ye Mathematiks', George Ridgeway, Edwark Elphick who was aged 29 in 1717, and J. Lidwell of Battle. Some of the maps are in poor condition. A number of reduced or draft maps and plans of doubtful value SCHEDULES OF DOCUMENTS. Mention has been made above to the lists of title deeds compiled by the Rev. Walter Budgen and by Messrs. Peake & Co. In addition, there are various lesser schedules of documents of individual properties, and lists compiled in 1809, and sumptuously bound, of deeds and other writings relating to the English and Welsh Estates GAME. There are 50 volumes of registers of game killed, 1836-1919, correspondence about the infringement of shooting rights, and some details of the cost of keeping game. Also some reference to deer MINERAL RIGHTS. Mainly concerned with mining for gypsum and the activities of the Sub-Wealden Exploration Committee. RAILWAYS. Papers relating to the proposals to run lines over Ashburnham property in Sussex TIMBER. An extensive series of woodcutting books, accounts, agreements and details of wood sales, 1773-1892 (with some gaps) will be useful to students of forestry and rural economy. The miscellaneous papers include the measurement of an oak tree used for the floor of the great hall at Ashburnham Place in 1851. The records should be used with the estate accounts VENISON. There are 12 vols. of venison books, 1822-1914, and similar records on loose sheets for 1769 and 1803-1814 MISCELLANEOUS. Eight items only, but including a steward's commonplace book for 1837 with information about trees, names of plants, and the state of the poll at the East Sussex Election; also an estimate for fencing the turnpike road at John's Cross. LEGAL MATTERS. While reference to law-suits will be found in the personal and estate correspondence, the twelve groups listed on pp. 112 and 113 seem to fall into a separate class. The earliest document is the case of John Ashburnham, c. 1680, concerning the estates of his grandfather. The papers in the action between the 4th Earl and the architect (W. L. B. Granville) responsible for the alterations at Ashburnham Place, 1849-50, consideration should also be given to marriage settlements and testamentary records where there are also legal papers. GENERAL CHURCH MATTERS. (The parish records of Ashburnham and Penhurst are in the Diocesan Record Office at Pelham House, Lewes. See also R. W. Whistler, 'The Ashburnham Registers', in Sussex Archaeological Collections, vol. 33, pp. 49-68.) These are papers mainly relating to the repair of Catsfield, Hooe and Dallington churches. MILITIA. A singularly complete group of documents for the period 1798 to 1811 concerning the Ashburnham Troop of Cavalry, with smaller sections for the South Lewes Volunteer Infantry and the Hastings Battalion of Volunteers An unusual survival is the samples of cloth submitted for the men's uniforms. MAPS AND PLANS OF PUBLIC SCHEMES are typical copies of official documents such as may be found among the archives of large estates. ROADS This section includes some useful material relating to the Flimwell and Hastings Turnpike Road.\nAdministrative history: THE early history of the Ashburnham family may be condensed to the statement that they first emerge as small landowners in the parish of Ashburnham in Sussex towards the close of the twelfth century. With some slight increase in importance they continued there for the next four hundred years, none of their members doing anything sufficiently notorious either for good or ill to find a place in the pages of history. By the time of Queen Elizabeth I the family had become great enough to tempt the heralds to record for them a pedigree fitting to their station and antiquity. Income from the local iron industry and the able administration of their estate enabled the male members of the family to take their place as honest squires, and to fulfil the military and civil obligations which their position demanded. It was the Elizabethan Ashburnham, Sir John, knighted at the Tower of London by James I on 14 March 1603/4 (W. C. Metcalfe, A Book of Knights.. (1885), p. 152.) who may be credited with starting the family on the road to fame and eventual fortune but, strangely enough, he it was who dissipated his patrimony, was forced to sell the estate, and who died in the Fleet Prison in 1620. But it was perhaps through the friendships bought by a squandered fortune that his son, another and more distinguished John, acquired his position at the court of Charles I through the influence of George Villiers Duke of Buckingham, a cousin of John Ashburnham's mother, Elizabeth Beaumont. John served his King with devotion whether in prosperity or adversity, and he suffered long imprisonment and heavy losses in the royal cause. He and his brother William acquired a right to the only two places afforded the family in the Dictionary of National Biography, and they both survived to enjoy the happier days of the Restoration and to augment the wealth and prestige of the family. From that time the Ashburnhams prospered. The Cavalier's grandson, John, was given a barony by William III, and his son--another John--was created an earl. A flair for the choice or heiresses, coupled with a rise in agricultural values, more than compensated for the decay of the Sussex iron industry, and the later generations were sufficiently rich to support its nobility with a proper magnificence. THE EARLY ASHBURNHAMS Before dealing with what may be termed the illustrious line of the Ashburnham family, some consideration must be given to its more obscure members. It is unfortunate that many of the picturesque legends concerning the family cannot be substantiated by documentary evidence; many of these episodes seem to have been the product of the imagination of Francis Thynne (1545?-1608), an Elizabethan herald (Another Elizabethan, William Camden, wrote that the Ashburnhams were 'a family of as great antiquity as any one in all this tract' [Sussex].) who has been followed by other historians either of doubtful sincerity or unwilling to verify their facts. Of the apochryphal events recorded, the most stirring is that concerning the defence of Dover Castle by Bertram Ashburnham at the time of the Norman Conquest and so eloquently recited by John Philipot, Somerset Herald, in his list of the Constables of Dover Castle and Lord Wardens of the Cinque Ports (See John Philipot's Roll of the Constables of Dover Castle and Lord Wardens of the Cinque Ports, 1627, edited, with an introduction and notes, by Francis W. Steer (1956), pp. 11, 12, 16.) This unfortunate Bertram is alleged to have met with a variety of deaths: to have been killed while fighting at Hastings, to have been executed by William the Conqueror outside the gates of Canterbury 'where he lived much esteemed, and to have been very active in the cause of liberty and his country', and to have met a similar fate at Dover. His sons, Philip and Michael, are said to have died with their father, and Reginald--Philip's son--to have been in possession of Ashburnham in 1166. It is curious, to say the least, that the Conqueror should have left the Ashburnham lands in the hands of the family of so versatile an opponent. Dover Castle was not very gallantly defended and it is said to have surrendered without a blow. And what was Bertram doing, presumably as an absentee landlord, in Canterbury? According to Domesday Book the owner of Ashburnham before the Conquest was one Seward. He is not otherwise recorded, but Ashburnham was wasted by the Conqueror (its value was reduced from \u00a36 to 20s.) (Victoria County History, Sussex, vol. 1 (1905), pp. 363, 396.) so poor Seward seems to have fought for Harold and suffered for it. The post-Conquest record is that the place was held by Robert de Cruel of the Earl of Eu (Ibid., pp. 377, 396.) It is probably from this Cruel (or Criol) owner that the real Ashburnham line begins. The de Criols (See 'Sussex Crusaders' in Sussex Archaeological Collections, vol. 9, p. 365, and J. R. Dunlop, 'Pedigree of the Family of Crioll, or Kyriell, of co. Kent' in Miscellanea Genealogica et Heraldica (1927).) came into England at the Conquest from the place now called Creully in the arrondissement of Caen. Once settled at Ashburnham they would likely enough take the local name instead of their own. Bertram was a common name in the de Criol family. In 1253 a Bertram de Criol was Constable of Dover Castle, and from this fact may have resulted a genuine confusion which made Bertram de Ashburnham to be stated as the holder of the office in 1066 (Sussex Archaeological Collections, vol. 37, p. 22; John Philipot's Roll, p. 21; S. P. H. Statham, The History of the Castle, Town, and Port of Dover (1899), pp. 334-5.) The unhappy episode at Canterbury may perhaps in a like manner be explained by a confusion between the name of the gallant Bertram with that of Bartholomew Ashburnham who did indeed suffer execution at that place (though in a less dignified form) in 1322. (See below.) A century or two was nothing to the makers of pedigrees as is shown by a gap of nearly a hundred years which they allow to stand unrebuked between the Philip who is said to have died with his father, and Philip's son, Reginald, who was alive in 1166. It is not until the second half of the twelfth century that the family definitely emerges from the mists of legend. In 1166, this Reginald 'de Esburneham' held two knights fees in Ashburnham (H. Hall, ed., The Red Book of the Exchequer (1896), p. 203.); he seems to have been a man of some substance for he gave to the monks of Battle Abbey 'all the land which he had in Hou, called Chelilande, and the land called Denne, with two salt pans in the marsh' (see Plate VI); these gifts were confirmed by his son and successor, Stephen. The 'land of Dudewell' was granted by the same Reginald 'de Hesseburneham' to the Abbey of Robertsbridge in 1194 (Calendar of Charters and Documents relating to the Abbey of Robertsbridge (1873), no. 23, and Ashburnham MS. A2.); Stephen's confirmation is reproduced as Plate VII. The family had now attained a position of respectability even if not of distinction. Stephen was followed by John, apparently a knight; he was succeeded by his son, Sir Richard, sufficiently important to marry Margaret, daughter of Sir John Maltravers, though not too important to adopt the Maltravers arms. (See W. S. Ellis, 'On the Origin of the Arms of Some Sussex Families', in Sussex Archaeological Collections, vol. 6, pp. 84-6.) This Richard was followed by another Sir Richard who married Katherine, daughter of Sir Richard Peverell, by whom he had two sons. One, Batholomew, was summoned to attend Henry III with horse and arms to Gascony and there to oppose the King of Castile. (See H. Drummond, Histories of Noble British Families, vol. 1 (1846), a source which must also be used with caution.) Bartholomew was a name given by the family to its more adventurous sons. In 1191 a Bartholomew de Esbornham appears in a Roll of Arms and among the knights who served under Richard I at the siege of Acre. (Sussex Archaeological Collections, vol. 9, p. 365.) There is no record of his having distinguished himself there. Another Bartholomew in 1322 served with the Earls of Lincoln and Hereford at the battle of Boroughbridge, where he managed so successfully to impress the King that on being taken prisoner he was sentenced to be drawn for his acts of treason and hanged for his homicides and robberies--a sentence which was duly carried out at Canterbury. (Ibid., p. 372.) Sir Hamond Ashburnham, the other son of Sir Richard and Katherine, married Maud, daughter of Thomas Elton of Elton. Their son, Sir Richard, married Isabel, daughter of Sir Thomas Morville, and their son, Sir John, was summoned in 1297 to attend the King in London 'on the Sunday after the octave of St. John the Baptist, with horse and arms, to go beyond the seas for his own honor and the profit of the realm'. (Drummond, op. cit.) There was no great profit to the realm in Edward's foreign expedition that year: one may only hope that Sir John himself came out of the affair with honour. He survived to obtain payment of \u00a3136. 10s. from Edward III in 1329 for oaks cut in Ashburnham woods by Edward II while the land was in his hands during the struggle with Thomas of Lancaster. It is recorded that 679 oaks were felled, of which 619 were sent to Dover Castle for the works there, and the rest to Pevensey Castle. (Sussex Archaeological Collections, vol. 17, p. 116, vol. 49, p. 19, and Sussex Notes and Queries, vol. 4, p. 131.) John appears in a Roll of Arms of Edward II with the shield of Gules a fess between six mullets argent (Sussex Archaeological Collections, vol. 30, p. 138.) which is still borne by the family (see Title-page). He married Joan, daughter of Richard Covert of Sullington, and gave his daughter, Mabel, to be the wife of Simon Lunsford. The John Ashburnham (son of Sir John) who was sheriff of Surrey and Sussex in 1396 also represented Sussex as knight of the shire in 1397 and 1398. (Ibid., p. 191. For the debts of one John Asshebornham, and his kinsman, Roger, see Sussex Notes and Queries, vol. 4, p. 193.) He married Mary Isley of Sundridge in Kent, and their son John was sheriff of Surrey and Sussex in 1402. He was one of the Commissioners of Array in Sussex in 1416, and the year before had been one of the retinue of the Duke of Clarence in the expedition to France during which the battle of Agincourt was fought. (Sussex Archaeological Collections, vol. 15, p. 125.) He had acquired, probably through the marriage of a kinsman, Roger, the manors of Ewhurst and Lamberhurst as well as his paternal holding at Ashburnham. Each of the three was valued in 1412 as worth \u00a320 a year. (Sussex Archaeological Collections, vol. 10, p. 144.) Scotney Castle in Lamberhurst remained in the family's possession until it was sold to Henry Chicheley, archbishop of Canterbury. John married Elizabeth Finch, and was succeeded by his son Thomas. Thomas Ashburnham was one of those of prime quality in the county of Sussex who in 12 Henry VI [1434] made oath on behalf of himself and of his retainers to observe the laws then made. (Burke, Peerage (1923), p. 148.) At that time any man who kept such an oath would have deserved well of his country. He married Sarah, daughter and heir of Henry Waunsey, by whom he had three sons. Of these sons, Thomas lived and died at Guestling, and Richard married a Stoneling and with her obtained the manor of Broomham where he lived and founded that branch of the Ashburnhams. John, the eldest son, succeeded his father at Ashburnham and married Elizabeth Peckham, by whom he had William, his heir. Perhaps he married again after her death with a Pelham, for in his will made in 1491 (P.C.C., 1 Dogett.) he calls his wife Johanne. He certainly had relationships with the Pelham family, for he had a lease from one of them of the manors of Burwash and Dallington Forest for twenty years at an annual rent of \u00a310. He died in 1491. The next master at Ashburnham was John's son, William, who married Anne, daughter of Henry Hawley of Ore, by whom he had a son and a daughter. The daughter, Jane, married first William Apsley of Thakeham, and secondly (as his third wife) Richard Covert who died in 1547, the brass erected to his memory may be seen in Slaugham church. (Sussex Archaeological Collections, vol. 23, pp. 179-180, vol. 69, pp. 199-200, and vol. 79, pp. 120-4.) The son, John, died before his father, but he had married Lora, daughter and coheiress of Thomas Berkeley of Aram in Hampshire, and left, at his death in 1531, a family of three daughters and a son. Of the three girls, Anne married in succession John Bolney of Bolney (1556) (Ashburnham Parish Register.) and Thomas Culpeper of Wakehurst; Jane married Oliver Denhan; and Alice married Edmund Daniell at Ashburnham in 1541. Old William was a landlord of some importance for in the will (P.C.C., 19 Thrower.) made two years before his death in 1532 he leaves to his grandson and heir, John, his manors of Ashburnham, Broomham, Peryland, Petordes Wrek (Petowes) and his land in Penhurst. He was careful about Master John, for his will goes on to say, 'if John Sackville Esquire cause the said John Ashburnham myn heir to be married unto his daughter now being about the age of five years according to such communications and agreement' as the two old men had made, he was to inherit without further ado. The marriage came off as arranged though not, one hopes, till poor Isabel Sackville had grown up a little. This younger John sat in Parliament for Sussex in 1554. (Sussex Archaeological Collections, vol. 30, p. 191.) He died in 1562 and was buried at Ashburnham. (Ashburnham Parish Register.) Isabel survived him for many years and lived at Lambeth; she was buried in the church of St. Mary Overie in 1584. (Ashburnham Parish Register.) Perhaps her second son, Thomas, lived with her as a consolation of her widowhood for she left him all her possessions. There were six children. John was the eldest; then Thomas (baptized at Ashburnham in 1549) (Ashburnham Parish Register.) and William, both of whom died unmarried; and three daughters, Eleanor, Anne and Margaret. Their father's will refers to his ironworks in Ashburnham, Penhurst and Dallington, and from its other provisions he seems to have been a comparatively rich man. The family prosperity was beginning. John Ashburnham had been born at Withyham and baptized there in 1545, (Ashburnham Parish Register.) so he was only eighteen years old at his father's death; he reigned at Ashburnham for twenty-nine years. He does not seem to have been much of a public character as his only apparent entry on to the historical stage is as one of the commissioners appointed to enquire into the properties of the Crown at Hastings; he seems to have stayed at home and cultivated his ancestral garden to some purpose. He died possessed of the manor of Ashburnham, also 'Pemborne alias Hurst quondam Shryswell and of Migham alias Willsham in Warbleton and Ashburnham', which his father had left to him. He may have done sufficiently well out of iron (See p. v; E. Straker, Wealden Iron (1931), passim; Sussex Archaeological Collections, vol. 2, pp. 169-220, vol. 3, p. 241; Sussex Notes and Queries, vol. 7, pp. 97-103.) to enable him to persuade and pay Mr. Thynne the herald to conduct those researches into his ancestry of which mention has already been made. But John did not share Queen Elizabeth the First's ecclesiastical views: an information for recusancy was laid against him in 1574, and by 1588 he had amassed so many unpaid fines that his estate at Ashburnham was sequestrated and three years later farmed out by Her Majesty to one William Cordell, her master cook. In 1569, John Ashburnham married Mary, daughter of George Fane of Badsell in Tudeley in Kent, by whom he had seven children. Besides his eldest son and heir, John, he had Thomas, William, George and Walter. Thomas was baptized at Ashburnham in 1573 and died unmarried. William was baptized there in 1582 with the Lord Treasurer (William Cecil, Lord Burghley) and Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon as his godfathers. These distinguished gentlemen were present only by proxy; but all the same young William had an aristocratic start in life. George Prison in 1585; it was too much for his constitution and the boy died and was buried at Ashburnham the same year. There were two daughters, Katherine and Mary, both of whom married Yorkshiremen, and both of whom paid fines for recusancy. John died in October 1592 and was buried at Ashburnham. His son and heir, again a John was (like his elder sister Katherine) born at Tudeley in Kent in 1571. Presumably he did not share his father's religious principles as he at once recovered the estate from Cordell the cook. On 27 November 1590, at the age of twenty, he married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Thomas Beaumont of Stoughton in Leicestershire, (See Sussex Notes and Quertes, vol. 10, p. 15, and the indexes to that and subsequent volumes for entries relating to the Ashburnhams in London parish registers.) by whom he had two sons, John and William of Civil War fame, and four daughters. There was an Elizabeth who married Sir Frederick Cornwallis (afterwards Lord Cornwallis); Frances who married Frederick Turville; Anne the wife of Sir Edward Dering; and Katherine of whose career we know nothing. John was knighted at the Tower of London in March 1603/4, and died in 1620 in his 49th year. He was buried at St. Andrew Holborn (destroyed in the Second World War) where there was a monument to him. He wasted his patrimony, records the monument to his son in Ashburnham church, by undertaking too lightly the financial burdens of his friends. He had to sell his property at Ashburnham for \u00a38,000 to meet his debts, and the estate finally passed for some years to the Relf family. After his death, his widow married Sir Thomas Richardson, Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas,(and G.E.C., Complete Peerage, sub Cramond.) and was created by Charles I (whether for her own sake or her husband's one does not know) Baroness Cramond in the peerage of Scotland. She wrote and published in London in 1645 a little book of pleasant piety entitled A Ladie's Legacie to her Daughters, in Three Books. (See also Ashburnham MS. 3501 on p. 40 of this catalogue.) John Ashburnham the Cavalier (see Plate II) (References to his associations with Charles I will be found in many books dealing with the Civil War period. A more recent group of references to John Ashburnham is in vol. 29 (1956) of the Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research (pp. 32-86) where Norman H. Mackenzie considers the career of Sir Thomas Herbert of Tintern. See also p. xviii and Ashburnham MSS. described on pp. 34-36.), born in 1603, was only seventeen when his father died, but he wasted no time in setting about the rehabilitation of the family fortunes. The monument to him (see Plate IV) in Ashburnham church says that within two years of his succession he had so far repaired the broken fortunes of the estate that 'there was not any of them but was in a condition rather to be helpful to others than to want supporte themselves'. At an early age, John seems to have broken away from the rustic traditions of his family and attached himself to the court in London. His mother, Elizabeth Beaumont, was of the same family as Lady Villiers, mother of the Duke of Buckingham, and under Buckingham's patronage began the court career of John Ashburnham. By 1627 he was sufficiently well known to Charles I who refers to him as 'Jack Ashburnham' in his letters to the Duke. His position after the death of Charles I was unenviable. He had acquired an estate by marrying, as his second wife, the dowager Lady Poulett (1649), and Charles II gave him permission to stay in England and look after it. The writer of the article in the Dictionary of National Biography says that the loyal party suspected his fidelity, and (March 1650) in a memorial to the king asked whether they might trust him. He was harassed by the victors. He was sued for debts contracted for the late king. He was forced to compound for one half of his estate, an unparalleled severity. He was bound in heavy securities to appear, when required, before the council of state. His private journeys were licensed by a 'pass' from the same authority. In his 'Narrative' he tells us that for three years he was so persecuted by committees to discover who had lent the King money during the wars 'as I had scarce had time to eate my bread'. 'Five yeares more', he continues, 'were spent in close imprisonment at London, and three banishments to Garnesey Castle, the cause being for sending mony to His Majesty'. We also learn from the Dictionary of National Biography that, 'In a list of the Tower prisoners furnished by Colonel Barkstead (2 June 1654), John Ashburnham appears as a prisoner for high treason; but this is probably a slip for William [his brother], who was in custody for complicity in the plot of Gerard and Vowel. John's case was (27 December 1655) referred to the major-generals of the counties where his estates lay'. John Ashburnham came back to his former place as Groom of the Bedchamber at the Restoration, and received such reward for his loyalty as the royal treasury, impoverished by many claimants, could afford. In September 1661 he was the head of a commission set up to enquire into the abuses of the Post Office, and made one of the guardians for the Duke of Monmouth; Ashburnham's house at Chiswick, with its contents, was bought by the King for the Duke. Loans which he had made to Charles I were repaid by grants of Crown leases, but his plans for the acquisition of land were not without difficulties which would have been absent in the former reign. For example, the Dean and Chapter of Exeter are menaced (November 1662) with the royal displeasure if they carry out their projected lease 'to John Ashburnham or any other'. He was elected a Member of Parliament for Sussex at the Restoration, so the most loyal county did not doubt his loyalty to the House of Stuart. (See G. P. Crawford, 'John Ashburnham, M.P. for Sussex, 1661', in Sussex County Magazine, vol. 5, pp. 317-8.) While young John was in the early years of his service with the Court, William, the second son, had been fighting in the service of the states-general in the Netherlands. But he came home in plenty of time to take a hand in the civil troubles of England. In 1640 he was Member of Parliament for Ludgershall in Wiltshire, and later Colonel of the King's 8th Regiment. (Sussex Archaeological Collections, vol. 36, p. 164.) In 1644 he was Governor of Weymouth which he held for the King for some months. On 3 June 1654 he was arrested and examined on a charge of complicity in the plot of Colonel John Gerard (1632-1654) to murder the Protector. But nothing seems to have been proved against him, and he was ultimately released from the Tower. After the Restoration Charles II made him Cofferer of his Household. Pepys speaks of him as 'an experienced man and a cavalier', and seems to have met him frequently at the Navy Office and at private houses; mention is made in the Diary of his 'odd stories'. There was one about the lease of Ashburnham House from the Dean and Chapter of West-minster where the 'devilish covetousness' of Dr. Busby 'was commemorated'. (Dictionary of National Biography.) So much for the public careers of the two brothers. But they were perhaps even fonder of Ashburnham than their forbears had been for the reason that they were so much away from it. Together they worked at the improvement of the estate and at the restoration of what the improvidence of their father had alienated. John rebuilt all the church but the tower and furnished it richly. (Plan and brief description in Victoria County History, Sussex, vol. 9 (1937), pp. 128-130, and in Sussex Notes and Queries, vol. 10, pp. 132-3. See also Sussex Notes and Queries, vol. 5, pp. 248-9, and vol. 12, p. 174.) William built an almshouse, (Sussex Archaeological Collections, vol. 13, p. 306, and Victoria County History, Sussex, vol. 9 (1937), p. 130.) and together they rebuilt Ashburnham Place. The work on the mansion continued through John's imprisonment, and the letters he wrote (see p. 122) to his cousin and son-in-law, Denny Ashburnham (who since he belonged to the Parliamentary side of the family was more free) show the pains he took to get it done properly. In March and April 1671, the two brothers 'shared in an enterprise for reviving the manufacture of tapestry at Mortlake'. William died in 1679; the splendid monument by John Bushnell to him and his wife, Jane (n\u00e9e Butler) Countess of Marlborough (died 1672) is in Ashburnham church. (Sussex Notes and Queries, vol. 2, p. 31, vol. 9, pp. 1, 2, and Sussex Archaeological Collections, vol. 32, pp. xviii-xx, and vol. 36, p. 168. See also Sussex Notes and Queries, vol. 10. pp. 64, 81 and 158 for references to William Ashburnham and Charles Toll, the latter mentioned (once as Charles Tott [sic]) on pp. 4 and 7 of this catalogue.) John married twice. His first wife was Frances, daughter and heir of William Holland of Westburton. She was gallant and dutiful enough to sell her own estates in order that the proceeds might assist John in buying back-the lands his father had sold. There were five children, (John was baptized 4 August 1642, and Bertrand on 1 February 1643/4 at Oxford; see Sussex Archaeological Collections. vol. 33, p. 56.) William John, Bertrand, Frances and Anne. Frances married her father's friend, Denny Ashburnham of Broomham, and had a daughter. Anne married Sir Hugh Smyth, 1st bart., of Long Ashton (see p. 122). John's second wife was Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of Christopher Kenn of Kenn in Somerset and widow of John, 1st Lord Poulett. By her he seems to have had more children, as four sons and four daughters are depicted on his monument in Ashburnham church. John died in 1671 and is buried in the vault below the church he built. His son William had died in 1665, but had married Elizabeth, daughter of the same Lord Poulett whose widow his father had married, and it was his son John who was the old Cavalier's heir. John Ashburnham the younger was therefore heir to his grandfather and his great-uncle. He was born at Chiswick on 15 January 1655/56, so he was altogether a child of the new age, and seems to have inherited nothing of the devotion to the House of Stuart which had been responsible for the successes--no less than for the disasters--of his predecessors. The Sussex estates which their foresight had made it possible for him to inherit must, by this time, have been considerable; both John and William the Cavaliers, had bought land largely and often, and young John added to his stature as a landlord by his marriage on 22 July 1677 at Westminster Abbey to Bridget, daughter and heir of Walter Vaughan of Porthammel House, Brecknockshire, through whom he obtained large estates in Wales. He carried on the tradition of activity in public life which had been the recent creation of the family, though the positions he held were more the accompaniment of his condition as a landowner than (as in the case of his grandfather) the fruit of his own abilities and strength of character. Nevertheless he had something of the diplomatic nature as is shown by the answers he gave to a set of questions propounded by James II to certain grandees of Sussex in 1688. John was Member of Parliament for Hastings from 1679 to 1681, 1685 to 1687, and 1689. From 1702 till his death he was Custos Rotulorum for Brecknockshire. As a baron of the Cinque Ports he assisted in holding the canopy over James II at his coronation in 1685 and (a thing his grandfather would not have liked) he did a similar service to William and Mary at their coronation four years later. He must have been one of the Englishmen who found that James did not, as a King, improve on closer acquaintance, and he therefore welcomed Dutch William. The welcome must have been appreciated, for a year after the Revolution John was created a baron. He died at his house in Southampton Street, Bloomsbury on 21 January 1709/10. Bridget died 12 May 1719 and, with her husband, was buried at Ashburnham. There were three boys and three girls of the marriage. The eldest son, William, succeeded his father as second baron. He had been Member of Parliament for Hastings from 1702 to 1710. In 1705 he married, at Carby [recte, Corby], Lincolnshire, Katherine, daughter and sole heir of Thomas Taylor of Clapham in Bedfordshire--a marriage which considerably augmented the family estates. But the young couple had only five months to enjoy their added dignity, for on 16 June 1710 he, and on 11 July following she, died of smallpox at Ashburnham, and are there buried. There were no children. THE EARLS OF ASHBURNHAM The next brother, John, succeeded as third baron. He was baptized at St. Margaret Westminster on 13 March 1687. From 1713 to 1715 he was Colonel of the 1st troop of Horse Guards; from 1728 to 1731 a Lord of the Prince of Wales' Bedchamber, and from 1731 till his death Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard. On 14 May 1730 he was created Earl of Ashburnham and Viscount St. Asaph. He was unfortunate in the health of his wives, for he married three and survived them all. His first marriage was with Mary, daughter of James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde, in 1710. She was then twenty, and in less than three years she died in childbed, and was buried at Ashburnham. Of her Swift writes, 'She was my greatest favourite, and I am in excessive concern for her death. I hardly knew a more valuable person on all accounts'. Apparently her beauty was confined to the inner eye, for her mother wrote very frankly of her personal appearance before the match (see p. 122). In July 1714 at the Chapel Royal, Whitehall, the Earl married Henrietta Maria, daughter and coheir of the 9th Earl of Derby. She died in 1718 in her thirty-first year and was buried at Ashburnham. The Earl's third venture was with Jemima, daughter and coheir of Henry de Grey, 1st Duke of Kent, (An iron fireback with the quartered arms of Ashburnham impaling those of Grey is described in Sussex Notes and Queries, vol. 6. p. 189.) whom he married at St. James's Westminster on 14 March 1723/24. The first marriage was childless, the second produced a daughter Henrietta (who died unmarried), and the third the son and heir. John himself died 10 March 1736/37 at his house in St. James's Square, Westminster, (See Diary of John Perceval, 1st Earl of Egmont, V, II, p. 367.) and was buried at Ashburnham with his wives. John, who succeeded his father as second earl and fourth baron was born in 1724. He held a number of official positions in which the honour was perhaps greater than the responsibility. He was a Lord of the Bedchamber, 1748 to 1762, a LL.D. of Cambridge, Lord Lieutenant of Sussex, 1754 to 1757, Keeper of Hyde and St. James's Parks, 1753 to 1762, made a Privy Councillor, 1765, Master of the Great Wardrobe, 1765 to 1775, and First Lord of the Bedchamber and Groom of the Stole, (See Ashburnham MS. 3202 on p. 4, and Ashburnham MS. 2900 on p. 123.) 1775 to 1782. His relations with the King seem to have been sufficiently intimate for him to take His Majesty to task for an omission to give him the Garter which he considered his services had amply earned. George III wrote letters of apology, but the injured dignity of Lord Ashburnham was such that he resigned his position at Court; this correspondence is noted on p. 123. He was originally a Whig, and protested against the disqualification of Wilkes. But age overcame his enthusiasm, and later he took refuge in the bosom of the Tory party. He built Ashburnham House in Dover Street, and in 1756 married Elizabeth, daughter and coheir of John Crowley of Barking, Suffolk, Alderman of London. (Son of Sir Ambrose Crowley, also an Alderman of London, by Theodosia, daughter and heir of the Rev. Joseph Gascoigne by his wife Ann who was daughter and heir of Sir Francis Theobald of Barking, Suffolk. On the death of Theodosia Crowley in 1782, the estate passed to John, 2nd Earl of Ashburnham, her son-in-law. See also Francis W. Steer, 'A Housewife's Affairs' (a study of Theodosia Crowley), in Guildhall Miscellany (1958). Through her came the Barking estates to the Ashburnham family, again proving the skin with which the Ashburnhams gravitated to heiresses. (Lord Chesterfield, writing from Bath in 1756. says, 'Lord Ashburnham is very soon to be married to the youngest Miss Crowley. At an average of fat and lean they will make only embonpoint together'. (Letters of Lord Chesterfield to Lord Huntingdon, ed. by A. F. Steuart, 1923, p. 95).) The eldest lived and succeeded his father. There were four daughters. The second earl died in 1812: we have two contemporary views of his character. Horace Walpole, who seems to have seen a good deal of him and frequently mentions him in his letters, calls him 'a most decent, reserved and servile courtier. He did not want sense, but it all centred in self-interest'. And George Selwyn, writing in 1782, says, 'I have the greatest opinion of his judgment in the conductive part of life; I really believe, if any man ever went through life with consummate discretion, it has been himself, and he has preserved his reputation at the same time'. The second testimonial is, perhaps, a slight improvement on the first. George Ashburnham, third earl and fifth baron, was born in 1760 and died in 1830. He was at Trinity College, Cambridge, and took his master's degree in 1780. From 1784 to 1795 he was a Lord of the Prince of Wales' Bedchamber, and from 1810 a Trustee of the British Museum. In 1829 he received from George IV the Garter which his father had so notably failed to obtain, and he was a Knight Grand Cross of the Hanoverian Order. His first wife was Sophia Thynne whom he married in 1784. There were two sons and daughter of this match, but neither of the boys survived their father, and Sophia herself died in 1791. Four years later he married Charlotte Percy, and by her had five sons and seven daughters. The eldest son of this marriage was his ultimate heir. Charlotte, Countess of Ashburnham, lived until 1862. George seems to have had various literary and antiquarian interests. He was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and in 1830 he published the narrative of John Ashburnham, his cavalier ancestor, with an essay in which he attempted the vindication of Charles's friend from what he regarded as the unfair and prejudiced criticisms of the Earl of Clarendon in his Life. (See Ashburnham MSS. 3947-3947 and 4342-4344 on pp. 34 and 35 below. John Ashburnham's Narrative' is also printed in Allan Fea. Memoirs of the Martyr King (1905), pp. 197-235, where the 'Narratives' of Major Huntington, Sir John Berkeley, Sir Henry Firebrace and Colonel Edward Cooke are also reproduced. Fea's book contains a good deal of Ashburnham material; Firebrace's 'Narrative' is also given in C. W. Firebrace, Honest Harry (1932), pp. 251-261, together with an important selection of Royalist letters.) In what he calls his 'Introductory Apology', Lord Ashburnham (then in the last year of his life) speaks (pp. 11, 12) of his own character and says that he 'can attest the uniform tenour of a life, throughout which he has as sedulously avoided, as others, at any period of theirs, have sought, to attract public notice; perhaps the foregoing protestations, here solemnly renewed, may be the better entitled to credit'. In the same preface he writes of his 'predominant infirmities; a constitutionally morbid indolence, and reserve'. The Earl was succeeded by his third son, Bertram, born in 1797; he lived until 1878 (see Plate V). He formed the great collections of printed books and manuscripts which were dispersed by his son the fifth Earl. He had been a great traveller in his youth, and collected many examples of fine art in Italy and the East. For the last thirty years of his life he settled down at Ashburnham to the care of his collections and to the government of his estate and dependents in the despotic and patriarchal manner of his ancestors, a manner of which he must have been one of the last English exemplars. In 1840 he married Katherine Charlotte Baillie, and was the father of seven sons and four daughters. On his death (A photograph of the funeral hatchment painted on the death of the 4th Earl is illustrated in the Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology, vol. 26, opp. p. 211. A similar hatchment is preserved in Barking church, Suffolk.) he was succeeded by his eldest son, Bertram, who was born in 1840. He will be remembered for his activities in attempting to restore Carlos VII to the Spanish throne; the archives relating to that affair were carefully preserved by the family The fifth Earl married Emily Chaplin who died in 1900; he lived until 1913 when he was succeeded by his brother, Thomas, the sixth and last Earl, who died without issue in 1924. With the death of the sixth Earl, the male line of Ashburnham of Ashburnham came to an end; the surviving member of the family was Lady Mary Catherine Charlotte Ashburnham (known always as Lady Catherine), daughter of the fifth Earl. She was born 3 January 1890 and died in January, 1953 (The display of the 4th Earl's hatchment above the principal entrance of Ashburnham place on the death of this lady provoked some correspondence in the newspapers.) A few months later the contents of Ashburnham Place and part of the estate were sold; a further portion of the property was disposed of in 1957 (Copies of these sale catalogues are available in the East Sussex Record Office (Ashburnham MSS 1057, 4459 and 3198 on p. 124).)",

        "Description": "The collection is very weak in family papers, but rich in title-deeds for the small parishes of Graffham and Woolavington and, to a lesser extent, for Billingshurst. These deeds are also valuable to the genealogist who, wishing to trace the descent of minor families, but finding himself bogged down by the absence of relationships in parish register entries, may get his information from title-deeds.\nAdministrative history: The manors of Woolavington, Graffham and East Dean were part of the estates of the Earls of Arundel. In 1540/41, William, Earl of Arundel (c. 1476-1543/4) conveyed Woolavington, with other manors in West Sussex, to the Crown, subsequently receiving other properties, mainly in East Sussex, Kent and Surrey, in exchange (Letters and Papers, Henry VIII, vol. 16 (1898), p. 428.). His son Henry (1512-1579/80) who succeeded to the title in 1543/4, received back, in 1555, Woolavington and most of the other manors conveyed by his father upon surrendering to the Crown the majority of the properties given in exchange (Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1555-1557 (1938), pp. 1-3. A translation of the copy of the letters patent on the Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer's Originalia Roll is in the Garton family chartulary (see no. 149), ff. 2-6.). In 1566, the Earl, with his son-in-law, John, Lord Lumley (c. 1533-1609) mortgaged the manors of Woolavington and Graffham, among others, and Woolavington Park, for \u00a31,300 to Edward Jackman and Richard Lambert of London (Deed enrolled on the Close Roll, P.R.O., C. 54/702, no. 49, and in the Garton chartulary, ff. 15r.-16v.). In 1574, Henry, Earl of Arundel, with his son-in-law and daughter, Jane, granted leases, each for 10,000 years, to twenty-seven copyholders of the Manors of Woolavington and Wonworth (or Graffham or Wonworth and Graffham) so as to raise even quite small sums of money which were sometimes payable in instalments. It is from these leases, or assignments of them, that the titles stem for many of the properties mentioned in this Catalogue. The financial position had not improved by 1578 when the Earl, with Lord and Lady Lumley, and John Jackman (son of the surviving mortgagee) conveyed Woolavington Manor and Park and Graffham Manor to Giles Garton of London for \u00a34,000 (Deed enrolled on the Close Roll, P.R.O., C. 54/1032, and in the Garton chartulary, ff. 21v.-23v. For the complicated story of the debts of the Earl of Arundel, which also involved Lord Lumley, see E. Milner (ed. E. Bentham), Records of the Lumleys of Lumley Castle (1904), pp. 63-72, the Complete Peerage, vol. 8 (1932), pp. 276-279, and T. Ryman's Foeodera, vol. 15 (1713), pp. 654-658.). In 1584, Lord Lumley conveyed the advowsons of Woolavington and Graffham to Garton, with a few unimportant pieces of property, for 200 marks (See Garton chartulary, ff. 32r. and v. Lord Lumley had succeeded to the property in right of his wife upon the death of Henry, Earl of Arundel on 24 February 1579/80.). This separation from the Arundel estate meant that Woolavington and Graffham became, for the first time, an independent estate, and a mansion house was built (See no. 18 and W. H. Godfrey, 'An Elizabethan Builder's Contract', in Sussex Archaeological Collections, vol. 65, pp. 211-223. The only remains of the Elizabethan house are part of the great garden wall, and a gateway of moulded bricks at the south-east angle of the garden (see Plate III). It is probably the bottom storey of the original gate-house. A remarkable map, 1597, showing the Garton mansion, belonged to the late Dr. O. M. Wilberforce, but a photograph of it is in the West Sussex Record Office (Add. MS. 2546). See Plate II for an enlarged picture of the house as shown on the map.). In 1589, Lumley sold the manor of East Dean, on the south side of the Downs but adjoining Graffham, to Peter Garton (Giles's eldest son) for \u00a33,000 after it had been mortgaged to him the previous year for \u00a3500 (See no. 238.). Mention must be made of Giles Garton and his business as an iron-monger; he lived at New Fish Street Hill near London Bridge. The miscellaneous bonds illustrate the range of his financial dealings, but the documents (pp. 110, 111) concerning his affairs with the Ashburnhams, Anthony Morley of Lindfield and the Challoners of Cuckfield (see no. 235) are of special interest (For references to these families and their part in the Sussex iron industry, see E. Straker, Wealden Iron (1931) and Francis W. Steer, ed., The Ashburnham Archives (1958).). Garton was a member of the Worshipful Company of Ironmongers and became Master in 1586; in 1570, he and Robert Goodyng were stewards for the burial dinner of the Lady Mayoress whose husband, Sir Alexander Avenon, was Master of the Ironmongers' Company eight times between 1559 and 1578 (J. Nicholl, Some Account of the Worshipful Company of Ironmongers (1851), pp. 105, 479, 544. This Account and The Ironmongers' Company: An Historical Note by the present Clerk of the Company (Mr. J. M. Adams Beck, to whom I am much indebted for his help and interest) illustrate the continuous importance of the Livery Companies of the City of London. There is evidence in the documents in this Catalogue that others of the Garton family were members of the Ironmongers' Company.). Garton's will (Dated 20 Jan. 1592/3, proved 10 May 1593 (P.C.C. 34 Nevell).) (no. 137) includes the bequest of a piece of plate--a standing cup--to the Company, and he asked for his body to be accompanied to the church by members of the Livery. Giles Garton died in 1592/3 leaving lands in Billingshurst, Kirdford and Wisborough Green to his son Giles, but the rest of his Sussex estate went to another son, Peter, who thus became owner of the whole block comprising Woolavington, Graffham and East Dean. Sir Peter Garton (He was knighted 14 March 1603/4; his son Thomas was knighted 10 April 1618. W. C. Metcalfe, A Book of Knights (1885), pp. 152, 173.) died in 1606 when the properties passed successively to his sons, Sir Thomas Garton (died 1618), Robert Garton (died 1633) and Henry Garton (died 1641) (The position is not wholly clear for an inquisition post mortem (P.R.O., C. 142/778/152) on William Garton, a lunatic, taken in 1638/9 (the date of death is not given) found him seized of the three manors and that his heirs were three cousins (see F. W. T. Attree, Notes of Post Mortem Inquisitions taken in Sussex, Sussex Record Society, vol. 14, p. 100). On the other hand, Robert Garton, by deed of 1633 (no. 48), declared that any person seized of the estate should hold the properties after his death--in default of issue--to the use of Henry Garton his only brother.). The estate then passed to the latter's son, William, who died in 1675, and then to his nephew, Robert Orme, the son of his half-sister, Mary Garton and Robert Orme of Peterborough. The younger Robert, who in 1691 married Dorothy, daughter of the 1st Viscount Downe, (For a copy of the marriage settlement, see no. 96 and W.S.R.O. Mitford MS. 331 (Francis W. Steer, ed., The Mitford Archives, 1961, p. 23).) died in 1711, and was succeeded by his son, Garton Orme. From this point there is more evidence available to illustrate the descent of the estate. In 1717, Garton Orme married (A copy of the articles of agreement on the marriage is no. 97.) Charlotte, daughter of Jonas Hanway, (His miniature portrait by Angelica Kaufmann was left to the Trustees of the National Portrait Gallery by Sir Orme Garton Sargent who also bequeathed Sargent and Orme portraits to the Lords Commissioners of H. M. Treasury and to the Holburne of Menstrie Museum, Bath; see The Times, 1 January 1963.) but almost immediately there seems to have been a financial crisis because in 1719 Orme found it necessary to mortgage various properties (See no. 783 for details.) to secure the repayment of \u00a31,730 due upon two bonds. The payment and investing of Charlotte's portion led to litigation (Chancery decree, P.R.O., C. 33/362, pt. 1, ff. 478r.-479v.). The position deteriorated so much that in 1747 it was agreed that a private Act of Parliament should be obtained, vesting the estate in trustees for sale, since Garton Orme had no means for discharging his debts which were set out in a schedule to the deed on the sale of part of the estate (In 1774 it was said that the schedule 'can't be come at' (see no. 790).). The Act (23 Geo. II c. 30 (Private); see nos. 98, 99.) gave trustees power to raise \u00a312,000, and in 1753 the manor of East Dean was sold for this sum (The deed is among the Goodwood archives in the West Sussex Record Office, but it has not yet been assigned a catalogue reference. It is enrolled on the Close Roll, P.R.O., C. 54/5915, no. 22.). In 1750/51, Garton Orme had sold the advowsons of Woolavington, East Dean and Graffham, which were not included in the Act of Parliament, to Anthony Nott for \u00a3700 (See no. 785; enrolled on the Close Roll, P.R.O., C. 54/5864, no. 13.) and in 1753 he mortgaged the whole estate (less, of course, East Dean) to secure a further \u00a31,300 then and \u00a3500 a year later (See nos. 491 and 58; there is a tart endorsement on the latter by R. G. Wilberforce.). Orme died on 24 September 1758 and his only daughter and heir, Charlotte, the wife of Richard Bettesworth, on 17 October 1758; the estate passed to their daughter, Charlotte, then aged about three, (See nos. 790-792.) who was to marry John Sargent. We must now turn to the litigation over the advowsons. Notwithstanding the conveyance of 1750/51 and the fact that Nott's assignee had presented to Graffham in 1754, (Subscription Book, Diocesan Record Office, Chichester, Episc. I/3/7, p. 6.) Charlotte Bettesworth, acting through her father as guardian, presented on the next vacancy in 1764 (Ibid., p. 131.) although it was later said that a writ of quare impedit was taken out by Christopher Bethell but proceedings were allowed to drop. (See nos. 790-792. The descent of the advowsons following the conveyance to Anthony Nott has nothing to do with this part of the Lavington estate history, but as the details are not in print and the Victoria County History, Sussex, vol. 4 (1953) under East Dean (p. 96) and Graffham (p. 60) is wrong, the information is given here. Anthony Nott sold the advowsons in 1754 for \u00a31,600 to Charles Lowe Whytell of Gilmonby, co. York. (no. 788), but after presenting to the living of Graffham as mentioned above, Whytell sold the advowsons some six weeks later for \u00a32,600 to Slingsby Bethell, alderman of London. He died in 1758 leaving the advowsons, with all his real estate, by will (P.C.C. 320 Hutton) to his nephew, Christopher Codrington, and his heirs male, conditional upon him taking the surname and arms of Bethell; see also Act, 32 Geo. II c. 11 (Private).) It seems that both sides wished to make an issue: in 1771 and again in 1772, Charlotte Bettesworth, through her father, entered a caveat in the bishop's registry against the admission of a clerk to the rectory of Woolavington without notice. (Caveat Book, Diocesan Record Office, Chichester, STC IV/6, f. 4r.) The issue came to a head in 1774. It appears that upon the death of Robert Smith who held the livings of Woolavington and East Dean in plurality, Charlotte Bettesworth wished to present Thomas Collins (whom she had earlier presented to Graffham (See no. 91.)) to Woolavington, and the Duke of Richmond (who owned the manor of East Dean) wished to present to East Dean. Christopher Bethell also presented to Woolavington, but the Bishop of Chichester refused to institute either nominee until the matter was determined upon another writ of quare impedit. The case, Christopher Bethell v. William [Ashburnham], Bishop of Chichester and Charlotte Bettesworth, was heard at the Sussex Assizes in March 1774, and a verdict given for the plaintiff subject to the opinion of the Court of Common Pleas upon the case stated. Charlotte Bettesworth does not appear to have pursued the matter (See nos. 790-795, 798, 799. The bishop's defence was nominal. The point at issue was whether the advowson of Woolavington was appendant to the manor or in gross. It was argued on Charlotte Bettesworth's behalf that it was appendant, but this could obviously not be sustained since in 1719 (no. 783) Garton Orme had mortgaged the advowson separately from the manor.) and Bethell's nominees were instituted to both livings (John Delap, D.D., to Woolavington and Andrew Lewis Boisdaune to East Dean. Subscription Book, Diocesan Record Office, Chichester, Episc. I/3/8, ff. 18v., 19r.). In 1778 Charlotte Bettesworth married John Sargent, (For the settlement of the Lavington estate, see nos. 108,109. John Sargent's settlement of his real and personal estate does not occur in this collection, but it is recited in no. 114. For John Sargent, who died in 1831, see M. A. Lower, The Worthies of Sussex (1865), pp. 295-297; copies of his dramatic poem, The Mine, are in the West Sussex Record Office (see Francis W. Steer, ed., The Crookshank Collection, 1960, p. 22).) sometime Member of Parliament for Seaford, (See J. A. Venn, comp., Alumni Cantabrigienses, Part 2, vol. 5 (1953), p. 422, and Francis W. Steer, ed., Records of the Corporation of Seaford (1959), esp. pp. 33, 34.) Queenborough and Bodmin. From about this time, efforts were made to strengthen the estates by acquiring adjacent properties, the money arising from the sale of the London estate in Downing Street, for example, being used for this purpose (See no. 114.). The Woolavington estate was further consolidated by exchanges of land with neighbouring owners. The eldest son of this marriage, another John Sargent (1780-1833), seems to have been intended for the law, (He was admitted at the Inner Temple in 1803; in August 1804 (no. 798) he is described as of Paper Buildings, Inner Temple.) but he took Holy Orders instead and it was presumably for this reason that, in 1804, his father bought back the living of Graffham and Woolavington for \u00a31,640 from Christopher Bethell (He was the nephew of the previous Christopher Bethell (who had died in 1797 without issue) being the eldest son of his next brother, Edward Codrington. On succeeding, he assumed the surname of Bethell by Royal Licence (London Gazette, 17 Nov. 1797) and in the next year barred the entail (no. 796).). The younger John Sargent was made deacon in December 1804, (Subscription Book, Diocesan Record Office, Chichester, Episc. I/3/10, f. 72v. The date is wrongly given in the Dictionary of National Biography and Alumni Cantabrigienses, Part 2, vol. 5 (1953), p. 422. See also M. A. Lower, The Worthies of Sussex (1865), pp. 296, 297, for other details of Sargent's career.) and although we have not succeeded in tracing his ordination as priest--it does not seem to have taken place at Chichester--he was instituted to the living of Graffham in 1805 on the presentation of his father. (Subscription Book, Diocesan Record Office, Chichester, Episc. I/3/10, f. 86r. The living was vacant through the resignation of Samuel Clarke appointed by Christopher Codington [sic] of Dodington, co. Glos., the previous year (ibid., f. 68r.).) He became rector of Woolavington on the same presentation in 1813 (Ibid., f. 174r.). In November 1804, a month before his admission to Orders, John Sargent married Mary, only child and heir of Abel Smith of Hull, a member of the well-known banking family, who brought with her, subject to the life interest of her mother, estates in Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire and a substantial personal fortune (See nos. 117 and 118.). The elder John Sargent died in 1831 and his son, the Reverend John, two years later. In 1834 his widow appointed, under a power in her marriage settlement, that the estate, subject to her own life interest and that of her mother-in-law (who lived until 1841) should pass to her only surviving son, Henry Martyn Sargent, (See no. 125.) but he died in 1836, before coming of age. She then, by further power of appointment, left the estate to her elder surviving daughter, Emily, (See no. 126.) who, in 1828, had married Samuel Wilberforce, (The marriage settlement was received in the West Sussex Record Office from an entirely different source: it is catalogued as Add. MS. 1579.) the celebrated Bishop, first of Oxford and afterwards of Winchester (He was the third son of William Wilberforce, the great philanthropist: see Burke's Landed Gentry (Wilberforce of Markington), Dictionary of National Biography, and A. R. Ashwell and R. G. Wilberforce, Life of the Right Reverend Samuel Wilberforce, D.D., 3 vols. (1880-1882).). The bishop died in 1873 when the estate passed to his elder surviving son, Reginald Garton Wilberforce. This is as far as the records carry us. The estate was sold in 1903 to James Buchanan, who was created a baronet in 1920 and raised to the peerage as Baron Woolavington in 1922; he died in 1935 (The Complete Peerage, vol. 13 (1940), p. 368, and W. T. Pike, ed., Sussex in the Twentieth Century (1910), p. 190. Some 1,282 acres of the estate were sold in 1941 (see Sale Particulars no. 25 in West Sussex Record Office).). Since 1946, the mansion has been occupied by Seaford College, a boys' school. The house, known as Lavington Park, was built in 1794 from designs by James Lewis (c.1751-1820); (H. M. Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of English Architects, 1660-1840 (1954), pp. 366, 367, and C. Hussey, 'Lavington Park, Sussex', in Country Life, 25 July 1925. The house was enlarged in 1903 and again in 1912-13.) it was described in the early 19th century (The Parochial Topography of the Rape of Arundel, in the Western Division of the County of Sussex, by James Dallaway (ed. by Edmund Cartwright), vol. 2, part 1 (1832), pp. 266, 267.) as being 'placed at the very foot of one of those acclivities which compose the prospect from Burton, and at a small distance becoming precipitous, is closely matted with low wood, and alternately bare and open, which harmonises with the richly cultivated valley beneath. It stands in a park, and has an aspect commanding an extensive and beautiful country, towards the north and west points of view'. The scene is much the same today. Graffham and Woolavington (the latter now generally known as East Lavington) are beautiful Sussex parishes, south-west of Petworth, with the Downs running through them. Both parishes are remembered for their former rector, Henry Edward Manning, who eventually became Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster. Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford and afterwards of Winchester, to whom reference has already been made, is buried in Woolavington churchyard. The printed sources for both parishes are small, but a selection of them is given on p. xii.\nArrangement: This Catalogue is a supreme example of what happens when archives become divided and when, to add to the confusion, the bundles themselves are broken up and their contents arranged in chronological order regardless of properties. To reconstruct the original bundles so as to be certain that they are correct has proved an impossibility because, in many cases, a document or series of documents could belong to two or more groups: the final arrangement, therefore, leaves much to be desired. In this gigantic jig-saw puzzle--if one may use the phrase--of over 800 pieces, one has had to contend with changes of name of individual pieces of property, with divisions of one property into smaller holdings, with the amalgamation of two or more properties, and with the division of a holding within a family. For what might be termed 'divers good causes and considerations', it has sometimes been found preferable to treat one or more groups of title-deeds as concerning a family rather than as relating to separate pieces of property. As a general rule, names are given as in the documents and variations are noted in the index. The names of witnesses are, in most instances, given up to about the middle of the 18th century, but some illegible signatures have been omitted because their interpretation would only be a guess--and probably a wrong one. Long documents such as settlements have not been abstracted in full where the originals are easy to read; for the same reason, it will be noticed that other documents, either late in date or late copies of earlier deeds with numerous recitals, have only received summary treatment in the Catalogue.",

In 1865 John Stuart Mill who had avowed his belief in Women's Suffrage in his election address, was elected to parliament. Some of the leading figures in the Women's Suffrage movement asked him whether he would present a Petition to parliament on behalf of the movement. He agreed to do so if a reasonable number of signatures could be obtained. In Nov-Dec 1865 Madame Bodichon and Emily Davies enlisted the help of Miss Jessie Boucherett, Rosamund Hill and Elizabeth Garrett to form a small informal committee to promote the Petition. They met at the house of Elizabeth Garrett and became known as the 'Kensington Committee'. Madame Bodichon, Jessie Boucherett and Emily Davies drafted the Petition and during the first months of 1866 they obtained the support of many leading women who between them secured eventually 1,499 signatures to the Petition from all parts of the British Isles. The signatories included many prominent women who made subsequently a significant contribution to the Suffrage movement. On 7 Jun 1866 Mill presented the Petition to Parliament which was at that time considering the Reform Bill. As Madame Bodichon was ill, Miss Emily Davies accompanied by Miss Garrett took the Petition to the House of Commons. At the Oct Congress of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Sciences held at Manchester, Madame Bodichon read a paper 'On the Extension of the Suffrage to Women'. (Transactions of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Sciences, Manchester Congress 1866, 1867, p.794). The Women's Suffrage Provisional Committee [London Branch](1866-1867) was formed in 1866. Soon after the Congress at Manchester, The Women's Suffrage Petition Committee decided to transform the informal Petition Committee into a more formal organisation, and the Women's Suffrage Provisional Committee was formed. The members of this London Committee were - Dean Alford (Canterbury), Miss Jessie Boucherett, Professor John Elliot Cairnes, the Rev. WL Clay, Miss Emily Davies, Lady Goldsmid, George Hastings, James Haywood, Mrs Hunt (Isa Craig), Miss Munning and Mrs Hensleigh Wedgwood. Mrs Peter Taylor was the Honorary Treasurer and at first Emily Davies acted as Honorary Secretary. Mrs JW Smith (a Garrett sister) soon acted as Secretary but she died in 1867 and Caroline Biggs, who was to edit the 'Englishwoman's Review' for nearly twenty years succeeded her. The Committee met at Mrs PA Taylor's home, Aubrey House, from which the petitions in 1867 were organised. ('Englishwoman's Review', 14 Sep 1889, p. 386 (Helen Blackburn's obituary for Miss Caroline Biggs). On 5 Jul 1867 the Women's Suffrage Provisional Committee in London dissolved itself and reformed as the 'National Society for obtaining Political Rights for Women' (1867), but was re-named within a short time as the 'London National Society for Women's Suffrage'. The National Society for Obtaining Political Rights for Women (1867) was formed on 5 Jul 1867 when the Women's Suffrage Provisional Committee in London dissolved itself and reformed with this name. It was re-named again within a short time as the 'London National Society for Women's Suffrage'. The London [National] Society for Women's Suffrage (1867-1871) was founded in 1867. On 5 Jul 1867 the Women's Suffrage Provisional Committee in London dissolved itself and reformed as the 'National Society for obtaining Political Rights for Women' (1867), but was re-named within a short time as the 'London National Society for Women's Suffrage'. There is a tradition that Mill was responsible for the change of name. (The Executive Committee comprised:- Miss Frances Power Cobbe, Mrs Fawcett, Miss Hampson, Miss Lloyd, Mrs Lucas, Mrs Stansfeld and Mrs PA Taylor who acted as Treasurer. Mrs Smith the Honorary Secretary died soon after the Committee was formed and Caroline Biggs took over, Mrs Taylor having acted until Miss Biggs' appointment.) In 1871 there was an organisational split into two separate bodies: 1) The London National Society for Women's Suffrage (1871-1877); 2) The Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage (1871-1877). The former appears to have been subsumed into the Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage in 1877. The Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage (1871-1877) (CNSWS) was formed after Jacob Bright at the Nov 1871 annual general meeting of the Manchester National Society for Women's Suffrage called for the creation of a central committee in London to co-ordinate the suffrage lobbying of MPs. Sure of solid support in the provinces, the Women's Suffrage Provisional Committee called a General Meeting at the Langham Hotel on 17 Jan 1872 at which Jacob Bright presided. (Notice of the meeting on 17 Jan 1872 and its purpose appeared in the 'Women's Suffrage Journal', 1 Jan 1872, p.13. A full report of the meeting in the journal's issue 1 Feb 1872, pp.21-3. Another good report, substantially the same, appeared in 'Englishwoman's Review', Apr 1872, pp. 113 'et seq'. Both journals gave a list of the Committees who had placed themselves in connection with the Central Committee.) This meeting passed the following Resolutions:- '1. That this meeting approves the general course pursued by the Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage. 2. That an Executive Committee be constituted with all necessary powers for promoting the movement subject to the control of the Central Committee.' The Executive Committee was to consist of the following persons elected:- Professor Sheldon Amos, Mrs Amos, Mr R Arthur Arnold, Mrs Arthur Arnold, Mr Ashurst, Mr Edwin Arnold, Miss Caroline Biggs, Mrs Jabob Bright, Mr Percy Bunting, Mrs Chesson, Miss Courtenay, Miss Frances Power Cobbe, Miss Agnes Garrett, Miss Rhoda Garrett, Miss Katherine Hill, Mr Frederic Hill, Mr Henry Hoare, Mrs Duncan M'Laren, Mr W Malleson, Mrs W. Malleson, Mrs Frederick Pennington, Mr Edwin Pears, Mrs Pochin, Mrs Peter Rylands, Dr Humphrey Sandwith, Mrs James Stansfeld, Mrs Venturi, Miss Williams and the following ex-officio members:- 1) All members of Parliament who are members of the Central Committee. 2) Such delegates as the Committees in connection with the Central may appoint (both reports contain names of 13 already appointed by Committees). 3) All members of Executive Committees in connection with the Central Committee. About half of those elected were already playing a leading role in the Repeal Movement. The structure of the Executive Committee fulfilled the need for such a standing Central Committee representing all Suffrage Societies as Jacob Bright had advocated at the meeting in Manchester on the previous 8 Nov. It was the dismantlying of this closely-knit structure with was one of the main reasons for the Schism in 1888. The Central Committee took offices at 9 Berners Street, the premises of the Berners Club for Women, and in summer 1874 it moved to 294 Regent Street (Langham Place). During the first half of 1872 the Executive Committee pursued an intensive campaign of public meetings and lectures, issued several pamphlets and endeavoured to increase their support among MPs and the press. ('The Women's Suffrage Journal' and the 'Englishwoman's Review' gave very good coverage of the activities of the Central Committee, including details of provincial committees and their officers as these were either reorganised or newly established in affiliation with the Central Committee.) Meanwhile the three temporary Honorary Secretaries had the services of a paid Secretary, Miss Emma A. Smith who was later retained on a permanent basis. The first Annual Meeting was held on 17 Jul 1872. (For accounts of the meeting, see 'Women's Suffrage Journal' 1 Aug 1872, pp.108-110 and 'Englishwoman's Review' Oct 1872, pp. 271 'et seq'. As the Editors of these journals, Miss Becker and Miss Biggs, were in the inner councils of the Committee, both journals gave extensive coverage of meetings, Petitions and provincial committees throughout the United Kingdom as these were established. The 'Women's Suffrage Journal' is particularly important for details of Committee membership and officers, in all issues.) To this meeting the Executive Committee presented its 'First Report', which contained a brief account of the events leading to the formation of the Central Committee. As the three Honorary Secretaries had intimated at the Executive meeting held on 12 June that they did not wish to continue beyond the Annual Meeting, Miss Caroline Biggs and Miss Agnes Garrett were appointed Honorary Secretaries for the time being. Miss Smith was appointed then on a permanent basis and Mr Henry Hoare was re-elected as Honorary Treasurer. Mrs Fawcett had remained with the London National but she later became exasperated with dissensions in the Society and joined the Central Committee. In 1877 the two London Societies (Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage; 1871-1877 and tLondon National Society for Women's Suffrage) merged to become the Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage (1877-1888) and Lydia Becker became the parliamentary agent. The London National Society For Women's Suffrage (LNSWS) (1871-1877) continued after the split in the London Society for Women's Suffrage (1867-1871) at the end of 1871, as a smaller Society. It mainly represented London as the larger and influential provincial societies had affiliated to the Central Committee. John Mill remained as its President, but he died on 8 Apr 1873. (Coverage of the London Society was small in the two Suffrage journals although all important meetings were well reported.) Outside London the Society arranged a few public meetings in those areas which had remained connected with it and the membership followed the established pattern of raising Petitions in their areas and supported the current leader of the Bill in the Commons. The London National Society For Women's Suffrage (1871-1877) appears to have been subsumed into the Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage in 1877. The Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage (1877-1888) was formed in 1877 when the two London societies merged: Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage (1871-1877) and the London National Society for Women's Suffrage (1872 -1877). Lydia Becker became their parliamentary agent. In the autumn of 1877, Jacob Bright was obliged to resign his leadership of the annual suffrage Bill in the House of Commons, and in Nov a deputation from the Committees of the principal Suffrace Societies saw Leonard Courtney, MP and asked him to take charge of the Bill in the Session 1877-1878. ('Englishwoman's Review', 15 Nov 1877, pp, 550-1) This he agreed to do, and he made an immediate major contribution to the movement by bringing together again the two London-based Societies. The 1871 split was thus brought to an end. During the next decade, the Society pursued its goal with the same strategy, the continual raising of Petitions through its affiliates, the annual measure before Parliament, local and national public meetings and a continual flow of leaflets and pamphlets. In 1888 the Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage (1871-1877) split into two factions over the issue of political affiliation, i.e. whether suffrage was a cross party issue. One group retained the name 'Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage (1888-1897)' the other became the 'Central National Society for Women's Suffrage' (1888-1897). The Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage (CCNSWS) (1888-1897) was formed in 1888 when the Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage (CNSWS) (1871-1877) split into two factions over the issue of political affiliation, i.e. whether suffrage was a cross party issue. This group retained the name 'Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage (1888-1897)' the other became the 'Central National Society for Women's Suffrage' (1888-1897). The Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage (1888-1897) was also known in this period as the 'Great College Street Society'. The committee included Mrs Fawcett, Miss Becker, Miss Courtnay, Helen Blackburn, Mrs Haslem and Frederic Hill amongst others. In Oct 1896 after a conference in Birmingham of all the suffrage societies, it was agreed that the country should be divided into regions. Thus the name changed in Sep 1897 to the 'Central & East of England Society for Women's Suffrage' (1897-1900). The Central National Society for Women's Suffrage (CNSWS) (1888-1897) was formed in 1888. In 1888 the Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage (1871-1877) split into two factions over the issue of political affiliation, i.e. whether suffrage was a cross party issue. This group became the 'Central National Society for Women's Suffrage' (1888-1897); the other group retained the name 'Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage (1888-1897)'. This group, which had party affiliation, had largely placed its faith in the Liberal Party to achieve Women's Suffrage. It was also known as 'The Parliament Street Society' (although it later moved premises to Victoria Street). In 1889 the Central National Society for Women's Suffrage lost members to the 'Women's Franchise League (1889-1897)' as would not expressly include married women in the aims of being eligible to vote. Members of the Central National Society included the McLaren family,Anna Maria Priestman, Mary Bateson and Jane Cobden. Between 1888-1896 the Central National Society was most active in the west-country. In Oct 1896 after a conference in Birmingham of all the suffrage societies, it was agreed that the country should be divided into regions. Thus the name changed in 1897 to the Central & Western Society for Women's Suffrage' when their activities in the West of England were 'officially' recognised. The Central & East of England Society for Women's Suffrage (1897-1900) was formed in Oct 1896 after a conference in Birmingham of all the suffrage societies, it was agreed that the country should be divided into regions. Thus the name changed in Sep 1897 from the 'Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage' (1888-1897) to the 'Central & East of England Society for Women's Suffrage'. In 1900 the Central & Western Society for Women's Suffrage (1897-1900) merged with the Central & East of England Society for Women's Suffrage (1897-1900) to become the 'Central Society for Women's Suffrage' (1900-1907). The Central & Western Society for Women's Suffrage (1897-1900) was formed in Oct 1896 after a conference in Birmingham of all the suffrage societies, it was agreed that the country should be divided into regions. Thus the name changed in 1897 from 'Central National Society for Women's Suffrage' (1888-1897) to the Central & Western Society for Women's Suffrage' when the West of England was added to its sphere of activity. In 1900 the Central & Western Society for Women's Suffrage (1897-1900) merged with the Central & East of England Society for Women's Suffrage (1897-1900) to become the 'Central Society for Women's Suffrage' (1900-1907). The Central Society for Women's Suffrage (1900-1907) was formed in 1900 from a merger between the Central & Western Society for Women's Suffrage (1897-1900) and the Central & East of England Society for Women's Suffrage (1897-1900). In 1907 the Central Society for Women's Suffrage (1900-1907) became the London Society for Women's Suffrage (1907-1919). The London Society for Women's Suffrage (1907-1919) was established in 1907 out of the Central Society for Women's Suffrage (1900-1907). 'The Women's Service Department': At the outbreak of the First World War, the London Society suspended its political work and placed its offices, its large staff of trained organisers and its branch organisation at the service of the nation. It opened the Women's Service Department whose work during the first months was to provide information to enquirers as to openings for voluntary work and supplied during that period over 1500 voluntary workers for countless organisations including major societies such as the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association the Invalid Children Aid Association, the Women's Patrols, the Belgian Committee and Soldiers' Canteens. It also opened 6 emergency workrooms for women thrown out of work, 9 clubs for soldiers' and sailors' wives and families, 2 clubs for girls, 7 hostels for Belgian Refugees, 3 centres for infant consultations and 2 clothing depots. The society's branches supported and worked with Mayor's Committees in many metropolitan boroughs. The Society also made a major contribution to the work of the Scottish Women's Hospitals, raised London Units and supplied special ambulances. 'Training Women For War Work': By mid 1915, the need for voluntary work diminished but there was a growing demand for trained women to replacement who had joined the armed forces as well as women for the increasing number of new jobs created by the expansion of production of war weapons and materials to meet the needs of the war effort. The Society's Service Department co-operated in the compilation of the Board of Trade's War Register for Women and also set about providing all kinds of technical training for women for entry to factories. Classes were established for such important work as acetylene welding, tracers for mechanical drawings and micrometer and vernier viewing. As the war progressed and the Society was able to raise quite considerable sums of money through appeals and fund raising activities, this work expanded greatly. 'The Women's Employment Department': Having made a major contribution to the training and placing of women in war work, as the war was drawing to a close the Society, with its very experienced organisation, turned its attention and resources to planning to meet the problems that women would face in seeking employment in the post-war period. Having briefly turned its attention, to political activity over the electoral bill which gave women a limited franchise in 1918, the Society re-thought its post-war policy and decided that apart from the battle to secure the franchise for women on the same terms as men, the 1918 Act enabled it to concentrate now more on obtaining equal rights and in this field employment was the major field for its activities. The Society therefore replaced the Women's Services Department by an Employment Department with an Employment Committee, organised with seven Sections. One of these was a Women's Services Section, the other six being Industrial, Political, Training, Publicity, Professional, Commercial and Civil Service Sections. These changes were made early in 1919 and a Resolution of the Executive Committee, 5 Mar 1919, gave effect to a Report of an ad hoc Committee on Advisors, by setting up a Council of Advisers which would consist of representatives of the seven existing Sections. The Executive Committee was empowered to call in representatives of any section for advice when discussing matters concerning subjects dealt with by that Section. A Report of a Sub-Committee on Public meeting, 9 Apr 1919, recommended the Employment Committee to sponsor a public meeting to be held in the last week in May in the Queen's Hall, to publicise the new policy and organisation. Women's Service Leaflet No.2, Apr 1919, was prepared, headed 'The Open Door' to serve the same purpose. The Employment Committee's staff carried out an extensive and intensive survey of occupations that might be suitable for women, interviewing a large and wide range of firms. A Bureau was established to which employers could notify vacancies which the Bureau's staff then tried to fill from those women who contacted them in their search for employment. Eventually, as the work expanded, this activity was taken over by a new organisation that was established by the co-operation of many women's organisations, namely the Women's Employment Federation. In 1919 the name changed to the London Society for Women's Service (1919-1926). The London Society for Women's Service (1919-1926) was created in 1919 through the renaming of the London Society for Women's Suffrage (1907-1919). The name change reflected the shift in emphasis of the Society's Objects, due to the Act giving women the franchise and also to the fact that the Society had added to its Objects a broader service to women as a result of its contribution to the prosecution of the 1914-1918 war. The London Society for Women's Suffrage had acquired a deep knowledge and experience of the broader aspects of the social and economic needs of women during its intensive contribution to the war effort, through its Women's Service Department. Once the limited franchise had been granted, the leaders and many members of the Society felt that in the post war years, while the Society should continue to work for the granting of the franchise to women on the same terms as men, there was a great deal of work which could be done to secure equal citizenship for women. It was therefore proposed that the aims of the Society should be broadened and that the name of the Society should also be changed to reflect this change of emphasis. The discussions in the Executive Committee resulted finally in the passing of the following resolutions at the General Meeting held 24 Feb 1919: 1) 'That the Society continue to stand for equal suffrage and equal opportunities for women, but resolve to concentrate its efforts for the present on obtaining economic equality for women.'; 2) 'That the Society resolve to promote this object by means of propaganda, political work, the collection and distribution of information with regard to employment, the promotion of trainings, opening up of occupations, and such other practical steps as may from time to time seem advisable.'('The Common Cause', vol xi, No. 524, 25 Apr 1919, p.17. The Executive and Annual Meeting Minutes and papers for the transition period are missing, and therefore it is necessary to rely upon the report in 'Common Cause'.). It was also decided to change the title of the Society to 'The London Society for Women's Service'. In a letter that was sent out to all members announcing these changes, the following was added - 'The Committee believe that the struggle to secure equality of opportunity for men and women in the wage-earning work is the next great step towards the full enfranchisement of women; they believe moreover that the forces which threaten the economic position of women to-day are of a most serious and menacing nature and that action is immediately needed to the protection of women workers.' 'They are convinced that a non-party of men and women who are united in principle and experience in practice will be able to give immediate support to the demobilised women, and that by building up public opinion and focussing political action on this group of subjects, they can best serve the cause for which the London Society for Women's Suffrage was originally called into being.' (The Common Cause, vol xi, No. 524, 25 Apr 1919, p.17. The Executive and Annual Meeting Minutes and papers for the transition period are missing, and therefore it is necessary to rely upon the report in 'Common Cause'). Two weeks later, the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies changed their constitution and title for the same reasons. The change of Object of the Union now allowed any societies having the equality of men and women as one of their objects to affiliate to the Union. This changed the relationship between the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship and the London Society as the latter's Annual Report presented at the Society's Annual Meeting on 16 Dec 1919 explained - 'That decision (i.e. by NUWSS) has fundamentally altered the relation of the Society to the Union of which it has been so ardent a promoter and supporter. Until last year, the London Society for Women's Suffrage Societies (sic) was the representative of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies in the Metropolitan area. Now the London Society for Women's Service is but one of several London Societies affiliated to the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship, each carrying out a different part of the Union's programme. This new relationship, which is no less harmonious than the old, results in a different form of co-operation and is perhaps best exemplified by the fact that the National Union may now properly hold meetings in London without reference to the London Society, while the London Society may carry on its work in co-operation with any other Society sympathetic to is special aspects of equality, without reference to the National Union.' (ibid., No. 560, 2 Jan 1919, p.503.) The report also referred to the rather pressing financial problems of the Society and after referring to the great work of the London Unit of the Scottish Women's Hospitals, hinted that it may have to close down that activity in the near future. The President, Miss Philippa Fawcett, in commenting on this problem, appealed for donations as well as subscriptions to enable the Society to carry out fully its aims. In 1926 the society was renamed the London & National Society for Women's Service. The London & National Society for Women's Service (1926-1953) was created in 1926 and was the renamed London Society for Women's Service (1919-1926). The name change reflected the shift in becoming the national body campaigning for women in employment. In 1953 it was renamed The Fawcett Society. The Fawcett Society (1953-fl.2007) was created in 1953, our of a series of predecessor bodies dating back to 1865 and the campaigns for women's suffrage. Best known as 'London National Society for Women's Suffrage' later the 'London Society for Women's Service' the organisation went through many name changes between 1865 and 1953 when it became known as The Fawcett Society. The name changed in 1953 from London & National Society for Women's Service (1926-1953) to The Fawcett Society in honour of Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett, the leader of the constitutional campaign for women's suffrage, and the president of several of the Fawcett Society's predecessor bodies. The Fawcett Society became the United Kingdom's leading campaign for equality between women and men, at work, at home and in public life. They campaigned on on women's representation in politics and public life; pay, pensions and poverty; valuing caring work; and the treatment of women in the justice system. They raised the profile of these issues by creating awareness, leading debate, lobbying politicians and policy makers, and driving change. They influenced developments such as: a change in the law to allow political parties to use all-women shortlists to increase the number of women MPs; the reform of the rape law; and a new duty on public bodies to promote equality between women and men. As at 2007 they were still active. Millicent Garrett Fawcett (1847-1929) was born in Suffolk in 1847, the daughter of Newson and Louisa Garrett and the sister of Samuel Garrett, Agnes Garrett, Louise Smith and Elizabeth Garrett Anderson. The sisters' early interest in the issue of women's suffrage and commitment to the Liberal party were heightened after attending a speech given in London by John Stuart Mill in Jul 1865. Though considered too young to sign the petition in favour of votes for women, which was presented to the House of Commons in 1866, Millicent attended the debate on the issue in May 1867. This occurred a month after she married the professor of political economy and radical Liberal MP for Brighton, Henry Fawcett. Throughout their marriage, the future cabinet minister supported his wife's activities while she acted as his secretary due to his blindness. Their only child, Philippa Fawcett, was born the following year and that same month Millicent Garrett Fawcett published her first article, on the education of women. In Jul 1867, Millicent Garrett Fawcett was asked to join the executive committee of the London National Society for Women's Suffrage and was one of the speakers at its first public meeting two years later. She continued her work with the London National Society until after the death of John Stuart Mill in 1874, when she left the organisation to work with the Central Committee for Women's Suffrage. This was a step which she had avoided taking when the latter was formed in 1871 due to its public identification with the campaign for the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. Fawcett, despite her support for the movement's actions, had initially believed that the suffrage movement might be damaged by identification with such controversial work. However, the two groups later merged in 1877 as the new Central Committee for Women's Suffrage and a new executive committee was formed which included Fawcett herself. Her influence helped guide the group towards support for moderate policies and methods. She did little public speaking during this period but after the death of her husband in 1884 and a subsequent period of depression, she was persuaded to become a touring speaker once more in 1886 and began to devote her time to the work of the women's suffrage movement. In addition to women's suffrage Millicent Garrett Fawcett also became involved in the newly created National Vigilance Association, established in 1885, alongside campaigners such as J Stansfeld MP, Mr WT Stead, Mrs Mitchell, and Josephine Butler. In 1894 Fawcett's interest in public morality led her to vigorously campaign against the candidature of Henry Cust as Conservative MP for North Manchester. Cust, who had been known to have had several affairs, had seduced a young woman. Despite marrying Cust's marriage in 1893, after pressure from Balfour, Fawcett felt Cust was unfit for public office. Fawcett's campaign persisted until Cust's resignation in 1895, with some suffrage supporters concerned by Fawcett's doggedness in what they felt was a divisive campaign. In the late nineteenth century, the women's suffrage movement was closely identified with the Liberal Party through its traditional support for their work and the affiliation of many workers such as Fawcett herself. However, the party was, at this time, split over the issue of Home Rule for Ireland. Fawcett herself left the party to become a Liberal Unionist and helped lead the Women's Liberal Unionist Association. When it was proposed that the Central Committee's constitution should be changed to allow political organisations, and principally the Women's Liberal Federation, to affiliate, Fawcett opposed this and became the Honorary Treasurer when the majority of members left to form the Central National Society for Women's Suffrage. However, in 1893 she became one of the leading members of the Special Appeal Committee that was formed to repair the divisions in the movement. On the 19 Oct 1896 she was asked to preside over the joint meetings of the suffrage societies, which resulted in the geographical division of the country and the formation of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. She was appointed as the honorary secretary of the Central and Eastern Society that year and became a member of the parliamentary committee of the NUWSS itself. It was not until the parent group's reorganisation in 1907 that she was elected president of the National Union, a position that she would retain until 1919. By 1901, she was already eminent enough to be one of the first women appointed to sit on a Commission of Inquiry into the concentration camps created for Boer civilians by the British during the Boer War. Despite this, her work for suffrage never slackened and she was one of the leaders of the Mud March held in Feb 1907 as well as of the NUWSS procession from Embankment to the Albert Hall in Jun 1908. She became one of the Fighting Fund Committee in 1912 and managed the aftermath of the introduction of the policy, in particular during the North West Durham by-election in 1914, when other members opposed a step that effectively meant supporting the Labour Party when an anti-suffrage Liberal candidate was standing in a constituency. When the First World War broke out in Aug 1914, Fawcett called for the suspension of the NUWSS' political work and a change in activities to facilitate war work. This stance led to divisions in the organisation. The majority of its officers and ten of the executive committee resigned when she vetoed their attendance of a Women's Peace Congress in the Hague in 1915. However, she retained her position in the group. During the war, she also found time to become involved in the issue of women's social, political and educational status in India, an area in which she had become interested through her husband and retained after the conflict came to an end. She remained at the head of the NUWSS when the women's suffrage clause was added to the Representation of the People Act in 1918 and attended the Women's Peace Conference in Paris before lobbying the governments assembled there for the Peace Conference in 1919. She retired in Mar 1919 when the NUWSS became the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship but remained on its executive committee. She also continued her activities as the vice-president of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, to which she had been elected in 1902, for another year. After this she became the Chair of the journal, the 'Women's Leader', and appointed a Dame of the British Empire in 1925. It was in that year that she resigned from both NUSEC and the newspaper's board after opposing the organisation's policy in support of family allowances. She remained active until the end of her life, undertaking a trip to the Far East with her sister Agnes only a short time before her death in 1929.\nArrangement: The records run on frequently from volume to volume and correspondence file to correspondence file irrespective of changes of corporate name, see CreatorName for a list of the predecessor bodies.

Themes The correspondence illuminates parliamentary affairs during SCC's career including the minutiae of protocol in the Houses of Parliament and parliamentary tactics. There is also much written about diplomatic negotiations that were carried out by SCC and his colleagues. Debate speeches; political offices; petitions; resignations from cabinet; new appointments and peerages; bills; and acts of parliament are all discussed in detail with the opinions of the correspondents on these subjects forming the main content of some letters. There is also much comment on party politics relating to the Liberal Party, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Unionist Party which was formed over the differing opinions on Irish Home Rule within the Liberal Party. Irish Home Rule and the effect of this subject on SCC's relationship with Gladstone and other politicians (also against the idea) is made clear through Gladstone's correspondence with SCC. Irish land reform, the army, universities and the Church are also covered in this collection. In their correspondence SCC presses Gladstone for his opinions on the government of Ireland and dissects their differences of opinion. Elections and campaigning are another well-covered theme of this correspondence and there is reference to campaigning for seats; the logistics of 19th-century campaigning; delivering campaign speeches; planning the most appropriate candidate likely to win in each seat; and letters of support or requests for it. The letters also capture political advice SCC sought from his father and mentors such as Granville in relation to election campaigning and his own role as a mentor to younger politicians in his later career. The relationship SCC and British politicians had with the press is also evident in these letters. It is clear from them that SCC had influence over what was published and when, and to some extent was in control of what information was leaked relating to affairs such as the war in Sudan in the 1880s. His own interest in a consortium of ownership of the Leeds Mercury and Manchester Guardian are also topics of his correspondence. The substantial influence that the Royal family had on the political affairs of the day is a theme that runs through much of the correspondence. It shows the close working relationship between Prince George, Duke of Cambridge as Head of the Army and SCC as Secretary of State for War etc. Queen Victoria's letters and those of her secretary, Ponsonby, feature prominently in this collection and show the level of detail in which she meddled with political affairs - from commenting on the movement of troops to vetoing the colour of military uniforms. It also illuminates the close relationship between SCC and Edward VII (and other Cavendish family members) on a political and personal level. Money and finance, both government and personal, are another theme of this collection. This includes loans between aristocrats; government finance in relation to war; a proposed royal residence in Ireland; salaries of government ministers; business dealings including shares in various consortiums or companies; inheritance taxes and livings. Possibly the widest theme of this correspondence is the influence of British colonial power on global events of the day ranging from Ireland across the British Empire and beyond it. The letters here show this influence specifically through the lens of the British Government and its ministers responsible for many of the decisions made in this fifty-year period of the mid-late 19th century. This is covered by formal government policies and also \u2018off the record\u2019 political discussions and opinions. The letters show the wariness and nervousness of politicians as they navigated the beginning of the decline of the British Empire and with it the need to be seen to maintain British prestige on the world stage. The letters discuss states such as Russia, the United States, Bulgaria, Turkey, Egypt, China, Afghanistan, France and Germany. It is evident how the delay caused by the means of communication (letters and telegrams) affected perceptions of situations on the ground and therefore impacted Government decision-making. Together these letters provide a rich resource on some of the most important foreign policies of the day relating to Sudan, Afghanistan, Russia, Egypt, India and Ireland that still have repercussions today for the UK's political dealings and decisions on the global stage. The correspondence provides a picture of the 8th Duke's political manouevrability; his interaction with fellow politicians and royalty; his social interests (such as horse racing, hunting, attending balls at Kimbolton); his patronage of Cambridge University, artists, societies, building projects etc; and his relationship with his family. His correspondence shows he was not afraid to have a difference of opinion and that he often used his diplomatic skill in the varied roles he took on as a politician.\nAdministrative history: Spencer Compton Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington and 8th Duke of Devonshire (1833\u20131908), was born on 23 July 1833 at Holker Hall, Lancashire, the eldest son of William Cavendish, 2nd Earl of Burlington and afterwards 7th Duke of Devonshire (1808\u20131891), and his wife, Lady Blanche Georgiana (b. 1812). His mother died on 27 April 1840, leaving also two younger sons, Frederick and Edward, and a daughter, Louisa. Education, the turf, lovers, and early political career The sons were educated at home. Known at first as Lord Cavendish, he was sent to Trinity College, Cambridge, at 18, in 1851. Without much reading he gained a second class in the mathematical tripos of 1854, graduating MA the same year. During the following three years he led the life of a young man of high social position. In January 1858 his cousin, the 6th Duke of Devonshire, died. Cavendish's father succeeded to the dukedom and estates, and he himself became Marquess of Hartington, the name by which he became famous (frequently shortened, in political gossip, to Harty or Harty-Tarty, though to his family he remained Cav or Cavvy). Hartington quickly discovered an addiction to the turf, and many of his happiest hours were spent at Newmarket, where he later built himself a house. He spent lavishly on horse-breeding. He was also a keen shot and bridge player. Hartington continued to indulge these tastes throughout life, playing bridge most days until the small hours at one of his clubs (the Turf, the Travellers', and Brooks) and rising late. From a young age he was a member of the social circle of the prince of Wales, later Edward VII. His high social position worked together with his natural secretiveness to obscure from contemporaries and posterity much of his early private life, though he is known to have had a long and deeply felt affair with the young society courtesan Catherine Walters (Skittles) (1839\u20131920) between 1859 and 1863. His habits of life were not viewed favourably by his father, on whom Hartington remained financially dependent until he was 58 (receiving a regular allowance and periodic debt settlements). Parental influence, in two senses, led to his return to parliament for North Lancashire as a Liberal and a supporter of Lord Palmerston in 1857. He was appointed junior Lord of the Admiralty by Palmerston in March 1863 and Under-Secretary at the War Office two months later. Palmerston, who influenced Hartington's political outlook greatly, died in 1865. In February 1866 Hartington became Secretary of State for war in Lord Russell's brief administration, thus entering the cabinet in his 34th year. In the early 1860s Hartington formed a lifelong attachment to Louise Montagu, Duchess of Manchester (1832\u20131911), the daughter of Count von Alten of Hanover. Her husband, the 7th Duke of Manchester, did not die until 1890, and in 1892 she married her long-term lover. For nearly 30 years, therefore, Hartington combined a bachelor lifestyle with an adulterous affair which was common knowledge in aristocratic circles, though successfully shielded from the world at large at a time when it would almost certainly have damaged his political prospects. He sometimes accompanied the duke and duchess abroad, but in public in England he and she always addressed each other formally. Like a number of Lancashire Liberals, Hartington lost his seat at the general election of December 1868. Gladstone, the new Liberal leader, offered him the post of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, which he declined. He accepted instead the office of Postmaster-General, with a seat in the cabinet, and in early 1869 obtained a new seat from the Radnor boroughs in Wales. His chief work as Postmaster-General was the nationalization of the telegraphs. In 1869 he was appointed chairman of the select committee appointed to investigate parliamentary and municipal electioneering. Following its report in 1870 he introduced the first of three government bills to establish voting by ballot. The proposal became law in 1872. He himself was a reluctant convert to the need for secrecy in voting. Irish secretary At the end of 1870 Hartington, much against his will, became Chief Secretary for Ireland, a job which required him to spend long periods away from his mistress and from London society. His acceptance indicated the extent of his commitment to politics. It also brought him into daily contact with the Irish problem at a time when it was beginning to pose a severe strain on British, and especially Liberal, politics. The Devonshires owned 60,000 acres in Cork and Waterford, and Hartington was naturally conscious of the need to defend the security of Irish property. He never wavered in his belief that the firm administration of law was the prerequisite of peace, stability, and prosperity in Ireland, and the primary duty of Liberal government. His first major act as Chief Secretary was to urge the suspension of habeas corpus in co. Westmeath in early 1871 in response to the campaign of agrarian outrages known as Ribbonism. Anxious to prevent the extension of priestly control over Irish education, he staunchly defended the mixed national education system and the independence of the protestant Trinity College, Dublin. He strongly disliked Gladstone's proposal of 1873 to reform Irish university education by subordinating Trinity to a federal university examining board, which Roman Catholic colleges might dominate and which had the option to restrict the scope of examination in deference to Catholic susceptibilities. The scheme was defeated in parliament, leading to the government's temporary resignation. Hartington's view was that the future stability and prosperity of Ireland would best be secured by encouraging investment, and to that end he argued in vain that the state should purchase and run the Irish railway network. Liberal leader in the Commons, and political creed The Liberal government was defeated at the general election of 1874. In early 1875 Gladstone announced his retirement as Liberal leader in the Commons, and on 3 February, despite his reluctance, Hartington was elected his successor at a party meeting held at the Reform Club. This was, not least, because he was almost the only cabinet minister to have enhanced his reputation during the 1868\u201374 government. Many Liberals also considered that Gladstone's Irish, religious, and foreign policy had alienated too many propertied voters and that a move in the direction of a more Palmerstonian approach would help to restore electoral confidence in the party. And Hartington's lack of clerical sympathies reassured those nonconformists who were hostile to the only serious rival candidate, W. E. Forster, on account of the privileges conferred on church schools by his 1870 Education Act. Hartington developed a quiet mastery of the post by the same qualities of hard work, fair-mindedness, and independence of thought that he was to demonstrate in all the offices he held. He was not a natural orator; one wit dubbed him 'Lieder ohne Worte'. But his speeches quickly became effective; they were clear, incisive, unpretentious, and unvarnished, and they exuded trustworthiness. The years 1875\u201380, in opposition, were difficult for the Liberals, not least because of an internal difference of opinion about how to respond to the 1874 defeat. Some, like Hartington, argued that a Conservative spirit was dominant in the nation and that the Liberals would remain united and recover power only by patience and consolidation. But others believed that the Conservative victory did not reflect public feeling and that the Liberals could build a majority by arousing popular fervour. The young Birmingham radical Joseph Chamberlain took this view. So, though nominally in retirement, did Gladstone, and his behaviour, especially on foreign policy, was a severe trial to Hartington. Disraeli's foreign policy aimed to strengthen imperial sentiment at home and British prestige abroad. Hartington did not object to these goals, and thought that opposition to them would be politically counter- productive. For this reason his criticism, in 1876, of the purchase of the Suez Canal shares and the bestowal on Queen Victoria of the title empress of India was limited. However, he did not approve of Disraeli's presentation of imperial policy, which he thought placed too much emphasis on empty pomp and display. His view was rather that the colonies were maturing, at various speeds, into a loose federation of progressive self-governing communities which would be beacons of commercial and constitutional liberalism, spreading 'all over the world the language, the civilisation, the laws and the customs of England'. On the Eastern question, which dominated politics between 1876 and 1878, Hartington criticized Disraeli's pursuit of grandeur, taking the view that Britain should have co-operated with the European powers in order to force through reforms in Ottoman administration of her European provinces, rather than ostentatiously breaking ranks and so bolstering Constantinople's intransigence. But he could not accept Gladstone's suggestion that the European provinces should be given autonomy, believing that the mixture of races there would provoke conflict, perpetuate instability, and encourage Russian penetration. And he was alarmed at the agitation mounted by provincial Liberals against Turkish misrule in Europe (which Gladstone inflamed). In his eyes it elevated sentimental above informed and pragmatic judgements of British and European interests in the region, and it looked damagingly unpatriotic, especially after England's traditional b\u00eate noire, Russia, declared war on Turkey in April 1877. Both in May 1877 and in the spring of 1878 Hartington refused to accept that there were no circumstances in which British military support of Turkey against Russia would be justified. The Liberal parliamentary party split at these times, a substantial number of MPs following Gladstone in a rigidly anti-Turkish viewpoint. However, Hartington regained control of the situation after the congress of Berlin of 1878, taking the view that the government was unwise to commit Britain single-handedly to maintaining the integrity of the Ottoman empire, given the impossibility of forcing through administrative reforms, and that the only viable solution was for the powers to deal with Turkey in concert. This policy, balancing pragmatism and moralism, maintained party unity in the approach to the 1880 election. At that election Hartington also condemned the aggrandizing impulsiveness which he felt had led the government into the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878\u201380), and developed a general critique of Conservative foreign policy\u2014that it sought to dazzle voters with empty, foolish, and costly gestures. He claimed that the government had lowered the standing of parliament, both by marginalizing its input into foreign policy and by failing to maintain a regular diet of useful legislation to meet domestic grievances. Though an electioneering gambit, this argument accurately reflected Hartington's constitutional outlook. He never deviated from the Whig view in which he was educated, that a vigorous parliament, active in legislative reform, was the key to the working of the British constitution, forcing government to take account of public demands, but filtering those demands in the course of discussion by independently minded men of property and education. However, Hartington did not think that parliament was now the only important forum for discussion of reforms, in the light of the growth of the press, elected local authorities, voluntary bodies, and the professions, all of which played valuable roles in shaping opinion and demonstrated the welcome pluralism of British public life. In an inaugural address as Lord Rector of Edinburgh University in 1879 he argued that the health of the British polity depended on the continuation of this diffusion of effective power among a great variety of free associations of informed people, but that this placed a heavy responsibility on the universities to train future members of these agencies. He urged a training in scientific and philosophical method, as most likely to cultivate the independence of mind and disciplined imagination that the prominent men of the future would need in order to resist 'clamour and exaggeration' and to supply cogent, disinterested leadership. In November 1877 he told the advocates of Scottish disestablishment and temperance reform that they must 'induce their Countrymen to agree' with them by a reasoned campaign of persuasion. Nor did he consider it his place, as leader of the whole parliamentary party, to associate with the National Liberal Federation set up by Joseph Chamberlain, which at this stage represented a selection of the large borough constituencies and sought to generate a policy programme out of the views of local activists in those places. At the 1880 election Hartington sought to rally the Liberal Party by a three-pronged attack on landed complacency. The extension of household franchise to the counties would weaken the grip of the tory squirearchy and make more Commons seats available for representatives of landed Liberal families. Secretary for India, and for war The Liberals won the election and Queen Victoria invited Hartington, who had been returned MP for North-East Lancashire, to form a government. However, Gladstone, who had dominated press coverage of the election owing to his speeches in Midlothian, told him that, as a former prime minister, he would not serve in cabinet beneath him. At this moment, the most crucial in his career, Hartington's diffidence overcame him. Sensitive to the difficulties of disciplining the party at any time, he rejected the notion of leading a government of which Gladstone might well become a back-bench critic. Instead, Gladstone became prime minister on 23 April. Hartington was appointed Secretary of State for India. His most important work in this post was to help settle the Afghan question. Amir Abdurahman was installed in power and all the British forces were withdrawn from Afghanistan, except from the Sibi and Pishin frontier districts, which with Quetta were permanently added to the empire. On 16 December 1882 Hartington became Secretary of State for War\u2014soon after the virtual establishment of the British protectorate over Egypt, for which he had argued vigorously. In January 1884 the British government decided to send General Charles George Gordon to superintend the Egyptian army's safe evacuation from the Sudan after it had encountered trouble from the forces of the Mahdi. Hartington, together with Lord Granville, the foreign secretary, was most responsible for this decision. Gordon's duties were defined imprecisely, partly because Hartington and Lord Wolseley, the adjutant-general, on whose military advice he relied heavily, doubted the practicability of the swift disengagement for which others in the government hoped. When it became apparent in March that peaceful evacuation had become impossible, and that Khartoum and Berber were threatened by the Mahdi, Hartington, supported by strong memoranda from Wolseley, repeatedly urged the Prime Minister and the cabinet as strongly as he could to prepare a relief expedition. Opposed throughout by Gladstone, he was unable to induce the cabinet to agree to do so until the end of July 1884, and then only by a threat of resignation. Consequently Wolseley's expedition\u2014sent by the War Office up the Nile, contrary to the advice of those on the spot\u2014arrived near Khartoum just too late to save that city from capture and Gordon from death on 26 January 1885. The government decided at first to retake Khartoum, and in parliament on 25 February Hartington pledged himself to this policy in the strongest terms, believing that the reputation of the Empire, not least among its Muslim subjects, was affected by it. But the feeling died away; the momentary probability of a war with Russia in connection with the Afghan frontier enabled Gladstone to withdraw from the undertaking, which he had never liked; and Hartington had the mortification of seeing the complete abandonment of the Sudan, resisting in vain the proposal to evacuate even the province of Dongola, which had not as yet fallen to the Mahdi. In retrospect Hartington considered the Sudan episode to be the most shameful which he had ever witnessed in politics. Domestic politics, distrust of Gladstone, and the Liberal split This imperial crisis intensified Hartington's unhappiness at the state of domestic politics, which had been manifest throughout the early 1880s; more than once he talked of retiring. One difficulty in these years was the impending democratization of the electoral system due towards the end of the government's term of office. Chamberlain exploited the uncertainty over the consequences, presenting himself as the exponent of a new programmatic politics. Hartington was angry at Chamberlain's behaviour and tone, which he considered were creating unrealizable expectations among poorer voters, but he lacked confidence that his own brand of politics could compete. So from the early 1880s he was thrown back on the defensive, and was generally seen as the leader of a whiggish section of the party. In this guise he opposed, in late 1883, the proposal to separate the franchise and redistribution parts of the electoral reform package, fearing that the latter would then be determined by a more democratically elected parliament. This did not happen, but more small boroughs were disfranchised in the Redistribution Act of 1885 than he wished. The dominance of the Irish question increased Hartington's defensiveness in these years. Indeed his anxiety about electoral reform in 1883\u20134 was largely caused by concern that the protestant minority in Ireland would be swamped in a more democratic representative system. Since 1880 Hartington had been a strong supporter of coercive measures to check agrarian crime and the power of the Land League. The regime of violence culminated in the assassination of his brother, Lord Frederick Cavendish, the new Chief Secretary for Ireland, on 6 May 1882. Though Hartington characteristically did not vent his feelings in public, this tragedy, and the serious threat of continuing agitation, strengthened his view that it would at present be 'madness' for Britain to diminish her responsibility for order in Ireland by granting significant power to locally elected bodies. In 1885 Hartington and his cabinet allies successfully resisted Chamberlain's scheme for a central board and elected county boards throughout Ireland. One reason why Hartington never carried out his half-threats to resign was the fear that it would throw Gladstone, and the party, more into the hands of Chamberlainite elements. However, the situation changed by the end of 1885. Gladstone's administration was defeated in parliament and resigned in June; Lord Salisbury formed a minority Conservative government, upheld by Parnell's Irish nationalists; and an election late in the year removed the Liberals' majority. Chamberlain's exuberant radical rhetoric was largely blamed for this, and his position vis-\u00e0-vis Hartington (who was returned for the new division of Rossendale in Lancashire) was weakened. Meanwhile, the fact that the Parnellites held the balance of power enabled Gladstone to avoid retirement and instead to recover office by embarking on a policy of home rule for Ireland. Most of the members of the previous Liberal cabinet decided to follow him, but a minority, led by Hartington, declined to accept office in the government which he formed in February 1886 after defeating Salisbury in parliament. On the introduction of the Home Rule Bill (8 April), Hartington declared his opposition to it. He insisted that Britain had a responsibility to secure law and order in Ireland and to protect property\u2014not least that of protestants with capital to invest in economic development. Gladstone claimed that his scheme guaranteed the continuing supremacy of the imperial parliament over Irish affairs, but Hartington regarded this as na\u00efve. Hartington's opposition was assisted by Chamberlain, and on 8 June 1886 the bill was defeated on a second reading by a majority of 30, with 94 Liberal MPs voting against it. Gladstone obtained a dissolution of parliament, leading the dissident Liberals to form a distinct Liberal Unionist group under Hartington's leadership and to fight the ensuing election in tandem with the Conservatives. Liberal Unionism, dukedom, and marriage The 1886 election returned 316 Conservatives and 78 Liberal Unionists. Salisbury, with Queen Victoria's warm encouragement, asked Hartington to form a coalition government or, alternatively, to serve under him in one. Hartington was tempted, because he was worried that the Conservatives, governing alone, would be too weak to resist Irish pressure. But he feared that acceptance would split the Liberal Unionists and encourage Chamberlain and others to revert to the Gladstonian fold, imperilling the Union; while he had not yet abandoned the hope that Gladstone might retire, allowing him to return to the Liberal Party as leader on a Unionist basis. Salisbury renewed the proposal in January 1887, after the crisis due to the sudden resignation of Lord Randolph Churchill; but Hartington again rejected it, for the same reasons. During the next five years Hartington continued with the strategy of keeping the Conservatives in power in order to uphold the Union, while hoping that this might force the Liberals to abandon home rule. However Gladstone did not retire, and the breach between the two Liberal factions widened owing to the government's strict public order policies in Ireland, which Gladstone opposed in an emotional and contentious manner. As a result, by 1891 the bond between Conservatives and Liberal Unionists was much stronger. On 21 December of that year Hartington became 8th Duke of Devonshire on his father's death and so left the House of Commons. He became leader of Liberal Unionism in the House of Lords, while Chamberlain led in the Commons. With Salisbury confirmed as leader of the whole coalition by the events of 1895, Devonshire's position was from now on that of an influential elder statesman. This was assisted by his marriage on 16 August 1892 to the Dowager Duchess of Manchester, because she developed Devonshire House and Chatsworth as prestigious social centres. Probably the most famous festivity was the historic fancy-dress ball given at Devonshire House in 1897, in celebration of the diamond jubilee, which was regarded as the most splendid London social event for over 20 years (the duke himself appeared as the emperor Charles V). When, after three years in opposition to an ineffective Liberal government, the Unionists returned to power in June 1895, Salisbury offered five cabinet posts to the Liberal Unionists. A strong coalition government was formed, which lasted until Salisbury's resignation in 1902. The Duke declined the foreign secretaryship. Instead he became Lord President of the Council, with particular responsibilities for the two political problems which most interested him for the remainder of his career, imperial defence and education. In 1890 the Duke had presided over a royal commission which identified weaknesses in defence planning. From 1895 he was chairman of a cabinet committee on defence set up in order to tackle these weaknesses, though its powers were inadequately defined, the service chiefs were not members, and it was unable to overcome obstruction in the individual defence departments. The Duke also chaired the committee which oversaw the conduct of the South African War. The progress of the war intensified concern about the lack of co-ordination in defence matters, and the defence committee meeting that he chaired in December 1902 drew up proposals to strengthen itself. During 1903 and 1904 these ideas bore fruit and a new committee of imperial defence evolved, including military advisers from outside the cabinet and, by invitation, colonial governors and dominion ministers. Devonshire chaired the committee until he resigned from the government in October 1903. He was also president of the British Empire League, formed in 1894 to promote harmony between the countries of the Empire through informal discussion of problems of defence, communications, and commerce. As Lord President of the Council Devonshire was in charge of government educational policy. He headed that group which believed that the state must respond to international competition by establishing a systematic policy for secondary education, for which it had not taken responsibility up to that point. After several abortive attempts, local education authorities for secondary education were established by the 1902 Education Act. The Duke was the politician most responsible for this act, and in particular for insisting that it should also deal with elementary education. As introduced, it encouraged the transfer of responsibility from school boards to local education authorities. In the interests of efficiency, authorities would, where established, also maintain the voluntary schools, which educated half of English schoolchildren. These had previously been funded not by the rates but by central government, because nonconformists had objected to paying from their rates for Anglican teaching. Characteristically, Devonshire rejected the argument of Chamberlain that the threat of agitation by partisan dissenters should obstruct the furtherance of a national interest. Indeed, during its passage the bill was amended in the direction of uniformity, so that all localities were required to set up local education authorities with these duties. After the South African War, Devonshire also became interested in the movement to investigate deficiencies in the physical condition of children, hoping that it would lead local authorities especially to address problems of overcrowding, nutrition, and physical education. He helped to establish an interdepartmental committee on physical deterioration, which reported in 1904, and he publicized its findings in a speech in the Lords in 1905. Like his father, the Duke was also anxious to encourage technical, scientific, and higher education. He was made FRS in 1892, and was president of the Royal Agricultural Society for 1893\u20134. He succeeded his father as Chancellor of Cambridge University in 1891, and discharged his duties there with energy, being especially interested in promoting the teaching of applied science. He was, for example, responsible for securing funding from the Drapers' Company for a chair of agriculture, established in 1899. At a meeting under his aegis at Devonshire House leading members of the university decided to launch a public appeal to rectify the lack of funding for laboratories and professorships in modern subjects. Devonshire gave \u00a310,000 and used his personal contacts to encourage other contributions. But the appeal was a failure, raising only \u00a3100,000 in all. He discovered that successful businessmen were reluctant to support the university financially, believing that its education was of little relevance to their world. He came to the opinion that a wide-ranging royal commission should be established, with a view to changing the content and tone of the courses by diverting powers and financial resources from the colleges to university teachers. He also remained interested in the university extension movement and, at the Privy Council, facilitated the grant of charters to Birmingham, Manchester, and Liverpool universities. He was chancellor of Manchester University from 1907. Many honours and responsibilities devolved on the Duke in consequence of his political and social standing. He was made KG by Queen Victoria in 1892, Lord Lieutenant of Derbyshire in the same year and of Waterford in 1895, and GCVO in 1907. In the control and management of his large estates in England and Ireland he was recognized as an excellent landlord and public-spirited benefactor; he took a particularly close interest in the development of Eastbourne. He presided over the successful restructuring of the family's finances, which had been hit by the agricultural depression and by the collapse of demand for the ships and steel produced in Barrow in Furness, in which his father had invested over \u00a32 million. He took advantage of the Land Purchase Acts to sell a lot of his Irish land and reinvested the proceeds in the stock market. By these means the family debt was reduced from \u00a32 million to \u00a30.5 million. He also continued the family tradition of opening Chatsworth to the public; there were 80,000 visitors a year by the end of his life, testifying in some degree to the respect in which he and his order were held. Free trade, tariff reform, and death The Duke, schooled in the principles of political economy by his father, was an instinctive advocate of free trade, unlike the majority of government supporters. Moreover, his involvement in the City encouraged him in the view that invisible earnings, which protection might jeopardize, would continue to underpin British economic success. He was willing to accept an inquiry into the merits of protection, in view of the damage then being suffered by elements of British industry. But careful consideration of the economic arguments did not change his mind, nor that of a minority of his cabinet colleagues. Three of them resigned after the cabinet meeting of 14 September. The Duke would have followed suit, had not Balfour informed him that Chamberlain had also resigned. Conscious of the supreme importance of holding the government together, and of his own indispensability, as leader of the Liberal Unionist forces, in that task, he allowed himself to be persuaded by Balfour to stay in office. But Balfour's strategy depended on leading the party some way down the road of fiscal reform, and as this quickly became clear Devonshire soon found that his position in cabinet was untenable. On 2 October he resigned, taking advantage of strong expressions in favour of a change in fiscal policy used by Balfour in a speech at Sheffield. The government never recovered from these events. The Duke strongly opposed the new policy of tariff reform in the House of Lords. In May 1904, recognizing that the Chamberlainites controlled the party's constituency organization, he resigned his chairmanship of, and connection with, the Liberal Unionist Association, over which he had presided since its formation in 1886. But the Duke was not among those free-traders sympathetic to an association with the reviving Liberal Party, believing that the Union was an even more important cause than that of free trade. So, having been a supporter of the dominant governing force during his entire political life, Devonshire's last years were spent out of sympathy with both major parties. In June 1907 he suffered a sudden collapse of health through weakness of the heart. Having recovered to some degree, he left England on 24 October and went to Egypt for the winter. On his way home, on 24 March 1908, he died almost suddenly at the Hotel Metropole at Cannes. His body was brought to Derbyshire and buried at Edensor, close to Chatsworth. He left no children, and the title and estates passed to his nephew Victor, son of the late Lord Edward Cavendish. Primary Source: Parry, Jonathan.

The following year his son Thomas married Agnes Holme at Mayfield and Edward Holmes Baldock, their third child, was baptized at Mayfield on 16 June 1778. The following year Thomas Baldock died, and in 1780 his widow married Benjamin Newnham, who farmed Huggett's Furnace until his death in 1808 Edward Holmes Baldock was described as a china man of Hanway Street St Pancras Middlesex when he married Mary daughter of John Gorringe of Buxted in 1811. A copyhold house at Buxted Wood, which had been built by Mary's grandfather Henry Weller and settled on the marriage, was the first of Baldock's many acquisitions of property in the area, all of which were copyhold of Framfield manor and had their origin in enclosures from the waste Baldock died at his London residence, 5 Hyde Park Place, Cumberland Gate, on 1 December 1845, and by a codicil to his will of 4 September 1843 established a charity for the poor of the parishes of Uckfield, Buxted and Mayfield Baldock's son, also Edward Holmes Baldock (1812-1875), continued to augment the Buxted estate by further purchases. He married the daughter of Sir Andrew Corbet of Acton Reynald Hall in Shropshire, and sat as MP for the borough of Shrewsbury, where he succeeded Benjamin Disraeli, in the parliaments of 1847 and 1852. Baldock died of blood-poisoning, having walked through a glass door at his house in Grosvenor Place, on 15 August 1875. The Shrewsbury Chronicle of 20 August described him as 'a staunch conservative and protectionist, and a strong opponent of the endowment of the Roman Catholic Church and its clergy'. Baldock seems to have had interests in several railway companies: his estate, valued for probate at \u00a3140,000, included large amounts of railway stock, and in the course of a purchase in 1847 (122), a letter was addressed to await him at York Baldock's only son, also Edward Holmes Baldock (1853-1913), lived at 8 Grosvenor Gardens and at Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire. He seems not to have added to the estate, which was still in the hands of his father's trustees when, with the concurrence of the court of Chancery, it was sold in 1899 Baldock used his half-brother ohn Newnham of Uckfield, a brewer, as his local agent and regularly instructed his cousin, John Baldock of Burwash, a partner in the firm Philcox and Baldock, in conveyancing matters. William Amos Scarborough Westoby, also described as a half-brother in the legacy duty account of Baldock's estate (PRO IR26/1728), but as Baldock's son-in-law in his own entry in Alumni Cantabrigienses, acted as conveyancing counsel on the purchase of Crossways Farm in 1844 (12-35); his relationship to Baldock cannot be precisely identified New House Buxted, copyhold of Framfield Manor, settled on the marriage of Edward Holmes Baldock with Mary Gorringe, 13 November 1811 On 21 June 1774 John Skinner and wife Elizabeth mortgaged their moiety of the property, described as a house, barn and four pieces of new assart (5a) at Buxted Pound (late Richards before Vandyke before Driver before Brackpoole before Holman and formerly Walker) to John Taylor for \u00a3100; Taylor was admitted on the forfeiture of the conditional surrender on 2 November 1787 (1) On 1 July 1788 the other moiety, together with a piece of enclosed waste (2r), was surrendered by John Dapp and wife Elizabeth to Henry Weller of Buxted yeoman, who was admitted to the first moiety on 21 July 1788 on the surrender of John and Elizabeth Skinner and John Taylor (2,3) Henry Weller's will of 8 April 1799 bequeathed his newly erected house at Pound Green where he lived to his grand-daughter Mary, one of the daughters of John Gorringe; she was admitted on the third proclamation of his death on 28 June 1802. On 13 November 1811 the property, occupied by John Gorringe farmer, was settled on the marriage of his daughter Mary with Edward Holmes Baldock of Hanway Street St Pancras Mx china man; John Gorringe and Daniel Harvey of Lewes were trustees of the settlement and Mary was given a power of appointment by will, with remainder to her sisters Sarah wife of George Buckwell and Ann and Frances Gorringe spinsters (4,5) On 19 August 1831 a map of the farm was produced by J[onathan] and S[ylvan] Harmer at a scale of two chains to an inch (6,7) For the exercise of Mary Baldock's power of appointment in 1860 see 165-170 below House and land (12a 3r) called Hamlin opposite New House, copyhold of Framfield Manor, purchased by Edward Holmes Baldock, 10 October 1825 By an out-of-court surrender on 16 June 1821 John Dennett Esq and wife Ann and William Franklin Hick Esq and wife Mary sold the property, described as a house, barn and new assart land at Buxted Street late Ann Hamlin formerly James Hamlin, rent 4s 3d, to John Mitchell of Buxted yeoman for \u00a3600, of which \u00a3490 was raised by a conditional surrender to John Dennett of Woodmancote Esq. On 10 October 1825 Mitchell and Ann his wife sold the property to Baldock, of Hanway Street, Oxford Street china man, who was admitted by his attorney Benjamin Hall gent, for \u00a3512 10s An undated plan of the property [by William Figg] is present in the bundle, pasted onto an advertisement for a straw hat manufactory (8-10) The whole estate, 1842 On 26 January 1842 Benjamin Hall, Baldock's agent, wrote to him from Buxted Lodge enclosing details of his property, occupied by Robert Berwick and Thomas Jenner, contained in the recent tithe appointment (11) The Crossways Farm, Britts Farm, The Whitehouse and a house at Pound Green, all copyhold of Framfield manor, purchased by Edward Holmes Baldock, 19 June 1844 This estate was sold to Baldock by different members of the Taylor family in one transaction, but consisted of three separate titles Title One As two Crossways Farm and Britts Farm, surrendered to James Coe in 1782 Crossways Farm consisted of a tenement described as a house, barn and 5a new assart near Totease paying 1s 8d; Britts Farm consisted of a tenement described as a house, barn and 4a new assart on Black Lane paying 1s 4d and two pieces of new assart (4\u00bda) formerly Mary Smith widow, paying 1s 6d. By his will of 19 November 1779, proved (South Malling) 4 July 1782, James Coe left these farms to his only son James; perhaps owing to James's failure to surrender to the use of his will, his brother Thomas Coe of Buxted yeoman was admitted on 10 July 1782 and immediately surrendered to his nephew James, an infant. The tenements had formerly belonged to Thomas and James's mother Sarah wife of James Coe, the sister and heir of John Smith of Buxted. On 25 October 1823 James mortgaged the farms (with other property) to Samuel Woodgate Durrant of Lewes cornmerchant and Henry Hurley of Lewes banker for \u00a31000; this mortgage was discharged on 8 June 1839, four days after another mortgage, for \u00a31,100 at 4\u00bd%, to Ruth Hurly of Iford spinster, had been obtained As to a tenement called The Whitehouse, inherited by James Coe in 1796 The tenement, described at as a house, barn and six pieces of new assart (13a, detailed bounds), late John Pettit, before Robert Pettit, formerly Burgess, was held by a rent of 4s 6d. The death of Thomas Smith was presented at a court held 10 June 1772; his wife Sarah who was entitled to the remainder, had died in Smith's lifetime and her grandson Thomas Coe, eldest son of her daughter Sarah, was admitted. On 1 July 1796 James Coe gent was admitted on the death of his brother Thomas and by an out-of-court surrender on 19 March 1822 mortgaged the property to James Winter of Burwash yeoman for \u00a3200 at 5% As to all four tenements James Coe died 20 June 1839 and by his will of 6 April left all his real property (except Foxhole in Buxted) to his cousin Mary Stevens (then living with him) who, as Mary wife of James Taylor, proved the will (South Malling) with Thomas Wallis and Ezekiel Weller the other executors on 15 October 1839. Mary Taylor was admitted to the tenements at a court held on 9 December 1839 and on 5 July 1842 mortgaged then to Ruth Hurly for \u00a3600 at 5% (12). Title Two As to a house and land at Pound Green, inherited by Richard and Martha Taylor in 1800 This property consisted of two tenements described as a house and new assart (3a) adjoining Bongcrosse or Pound Green near a house formerly called the White Horse, paying 1s, and a piece of new assart (2a meadow, S& W of Buxted Wood and N of the road) late Goffe, before Burgess, paying 8d The death of Lucy Brunsden was presented on 29 June 1787 and her youngest son William Brunsden admitted to the tenements according to her will of 10 November 1778. On 10 September 1799 William Brunsden and wife Jane surrendered to Martha Stanbridge of Buxted widow who on 5 Mar 1800 mortgaged to Elizabeth Susan of Buxted widow for \u00a3150 Martha Stanbridge died 23 June 1800 and by her will of 1 March, proved 6 December, bequeathed the house where she lived with the shop which he occupied to her son-in-law Richard Taylor of Buxted carpenter and his wife, her daughter Martha. Thomas, eldest son of Elizabeth Susans was admitted to the tenements on default of repayment of the mortgage of 1800 on 21 June 1828 and assigned to George Hollands of Buxted shopkeeper. Hollands died and by his will of 29 January 1818, proved in PCC 9 May 1832, the legal estate passed to his wife Sarah for life with remainder to his son John Hollands; she was admitted at a court held 20 June 1832 (20-26) Title Three As to Batchelors Lane (1r 34p) and Harpers Lane (35p) purchased by James Taylor in 1840 By an order made at a special highway session at Uckfield on 14 September 1826 several lanes in the parish of Buxted were stopped up; reference is made in the public notice, signed by George Gwynne as clerk to the justices, of a plan to be deposited the with clerk of the peace [for which see QRE 789] Batchelors Lane was sold by the parish highway surveyors for \u00a32 9s 4d to John Catt on 9 October 1827 who sold it to James Taylor for \u00a327 on 23 July 1840. Also included in the papers is a printed notice recording the decision of a meeting of the copyholders of Framfield Manor on 22 June to consider the advantages of a general enclosure of the wastes of the manor at another meeting on 20 July 1829; Mr John Smith is recorded as chairman, S Lidbetter as honorary secretary (37) Part of Harpers Lane, described in the order as Bretts Lane (a right of way reserved to the tenants of James Coe's farm occupied by William Brett - see above), was sold by the surveyors for \u00a32 14s to William Britt on 18 December 1827 who sold it to James Taylor for \u00a315 on 24 July 1840 (38) Purchase of titles 1-3 above by Edward Holmes Baldock of Hyde Park Place St Marylebone An agreement to purchase for \u00a31700, in which Crossways Farm (see above) was described as freehold, was reached on 11 April 1844; Philcox and Baldock of Burwash acted for the purchaser, Verral Lewis and Verral of Lewes for the vendors. Two abstracts of title (12,26) were considered by William A S Westoby of Lincolns Inn on 20 & 21 May 1844 whose observations required copies of entries of baptism, marriage and burial of members of the Taylor family (14,1 5, 30, 31, 35), extracts of wills of Henry Hurly of Iford (16), James Coe of Buxted (17), the administration of Thomas Coe of Buxted (18), George Holland (29) and Martha Stanbridge (32), statutory declarations by Thomas Fry of Buxted farmer aged 85 concerning the Coe family, Sarah Hollands of Buxted widow aged 80 concerning Richard Taylor's children (33) and Thomas Fry concerning George Hollands (34) [for details of the bankruptcy of John son of George and Sarah Hollands in 1844 see 196 below] A discrepancy between acreages on the agreement and conveyance and the misdescription of Crossways Farm as freehold was settled by the abatement of \u00a3100 from the purchase price According to Westoby's advice, the transaction at the manorial court involved an admission of John Holland to the legal estate and his surrender to Baldock in respect of title two; the manorial steward refused to allow James Taylor to be admitted to the two lanes (title three) so a fresh grant was made to Baldock at a rent of 4d (39). Separate deeds of 19 June 1844 covenanted the title of the property, and the equity of redemption of title two was released to Baldock by the four sons of Richard Taylor (d 1831) and Martha his wife (d 1842) - Thomas Stanbridge Taylor and Richard Taylor of Buxted husbandmen, James Taylor of Buxted farmer and Henry Taylor of Buxted shopkeeper who, once the mortgage had been discharged, each received \u00a362 10s from the purchase price of \u00a3400; titles one and three, subject to a \u00a3600 mortgage, were sold by James and Mary Taylor for \u00a31200 (40-45) Cottages at Pound Green, copyhold of Framfield Manor, purchased by Edward Holmes Baldock on 9 July 1845 The property was described in 1845 as a house converted into three dwellings and assart land (\u00bda) near the Pound Place late Nash, before Wilmshurst, before Cook, before Stevens and before Harris, rent 2d Robert Wilmshurst, son of Christian wife of William Wilmshurst who was heir of John Cook, was admitted to the tenement (still described as a single house) on the proclamation of the latter's death on 7 July 1774; he surrendered to the use of his will (46). On Wilmshurst's death, presented 21 June 1822, William Nash the only son of his sister Elizabeth Nash was admitted and on 21 June 1830 the property was surrendered to Henry Batchelor of Buxted gardener by William Nash and Mary his wife (47, 48) On 17 August 1844 Benjamin Hall, Baldock's solicitor, wrote to John Newnham at Uckfield concerning the purchase, enclosing a list of documents 46-48 and advising that Mr Holland's cottages at Redbrook would be sold the next week (49). Edward Holmes Baldock was admitted to the tenement on the surrender Henry Batchelor and wife Elizabeth for \u00a3100 on 9 July 1845 and an agreement was reached that Batchelor should continue to live in and enjoy the property for the term of his life; Hall and Mourilyan's account to Baldock for the purchase reveals that Mrs Batchelor refused to consent to the surrender until her husband had made his will (50-52) Pound Green Lane and other waste, purchased by Edward Holmes Baldock on 9 July 1845 Pound Green Lane was among the lanes in Buxted stopped up by an order of Quarter Sessions on 30 June 1845; a public notice, signed by George Eade the parish highway surveyor, mentions a plan deposited with the clerk of the peace [for which see QRE 909], and is also endorsed with an undated receipt for \u00a38 8s from the vestry committees to Baldock (53). Baldock was admitted to the land, to be held of the manor of Framfield at a rent of 6d; the grant also included other pieces of waste at Pound Green and its mention of a new parish road suggests that the surveyors were disposing of redundant land (54,55). By the time John Newnham signed a receipt for the highway surveyors on 11 July, the price had fallen to \u00a37 16s (56) House, cottage, barn and land (12a), copyhold of Framfield Manor, purchased by Edward Holmes Baldock 29 September 1845 The property, which consisted of six tenements described and bounded in detail on the court rolls, was entailed by the will of Nicholas Carratt, 21 June 1745, which was enrolled at a court held 12 May 1763. The second proclamation of the death of Elizabeth Wood widow was made 20 June 1806 and her only son Nicholas Wood was admitted by virtue of the entail, suffered a common recovery and, with his wife Mary, mortgaged the property to Richard Holmwood of Hellingly gent for \u00a3150 at 5% (57) The mortgage was assigned to Thomas Susans of Buxted yeoman and a further charge of \u00a350 incurred on 10 December 1814 and on 8 December 1821, when Mary Wood widow was admitted to a life estate by virture of her husband's will of 8 November 1819 (proved South Malling 17 January 1820), assigned again with a further charge of \u00a320 by Mary and her son James Wood, the remainderman, both of Heathfield, to William Baker of Heathfield gent (58-60) By the time Mary Wood's death was presented on 20 June 1834 her son James had also died and his eldest daughter Jane wife of Thomas Balcomb was admitted; on 30 April 1838 they sold the property to William Curd of Buxted yeoman for \u00a3525 of which \u00a3225 was advanced by the vendors at 4\u00bd% (61-63). Edward Holmes Baldock of 5 Hyde Park Place agreed to purchase the property from William Curd for \u00a3600 on 11 July 1845; on 17 September extracts were obtained from the registers of Heathfield of the marriage of James Wood and Ann Oxly and the baptism of their three daughters and on 29 September John Shipton of Uckfield butcher, aged 75, made a statutory declaration that James Wood had died intestate in 1828 and that Jane Balcombe was his eldest daughter (64-67) The property, occupied by William Curd and his tenant James May, was surrendered to Baldock out of court on 29 September 1845 and a deed of covenants concerning the title executed by Curd and Thomas Balcomb of Lye Green in Withyham, smith, whose mortgage was paid off. According to the terms of the contract, the farm was leased back to the vendor for 50 years or life at \u00a310 a year; Philcox and Baldock of Burwash again acted for the purchaser (68-71). Baldock died before he could be admitted to the property; for the admissionn of his son on the surrender on 17 June 1846 see 72-73 below The whole estate, 1846 At a court held on 17 June 1846 Edward Holmes Baldock esq was admitted to his father's copyhold property on production of the latter's will of 4 September 1843, proved in PCC 13 January 1846. He was also admitted to the property surrendered to his father on 29 September 1845 (see 57-73 above) by William Curd, whose receipt for the purchase price is attached to the copy (72,73) House Lodge and land (13a) called late Filtnesses, copyhold of Framfield Manor, purchased by Edward Holmes Baldock, 17 June 1846 The property, which consisted of five tenemants, is described in detail on the court rolls; for a plan executed in 1833 see 106 below. The vendor, William Baldock of Buxted yeoman, had purchased the property in 1825 and although a large amount of conveyancing correspondence has been preserved from that transaction, relatively little survives from that of 1846 As to late Filtnesses, purchased by Henry Weller in 1789 On 19 April 1754 the property, near the White Horse in Buxted, late Butchers and before Collins, was settled by John Baker on himself and his wife Caroline for their lives with remainder to his daughters Elizabeth wife of John Filtness blacksmith and Caroline and Martha Baker spinsters (84) On 26 January 1758 Martha Baker was admitted to a grant of waste abutting her father's cottage, with the consent of James Coe (see 12 above) the neighbouring owner (74) On 3 April 1771 Elizabeth Filtness was admitted to her reversionary interest (John Baker was dead but her mother was still alive) in order to mortgage it to John Alchorn of Buxted yeoman for \u00a320; on 13 July 1773 the mortgage was assigned to Thomas Coe of Rotherfield On 11 March 1789 Elizabeth Filtness was admitted to the third share of her sister Caroline, who had died unmarried, and immediately surrendered that and her own share to Henry Weller of Buxted yeoman, to whom Martha Baker's share was surrendered by her son John son of Benjamin Shelley; Weller was also admitted to the piece of waste on John Shelley's surrender (75) As to late Brunsdens, purchased by Henry Weller in 1790 On 26 January 1758 the Lord of Framfield Manor, with the permission of John Baker (see above), granted a piece of waste (\u00bda) W of Baker's land and E,N and S of Buxted Wood, to Stephen Brunsden, wbose eldest son Edward Brunsden was admitted on the third proclamation of his father's death on 27 June 1783. On 18 December 1790 Edward Brunsden and wife Sarah surrendered the property to Henry Weller, who was admitted at a court held 1 July 1791 (76-78) As to the whole estate Henry Weller's will of 8 April 1799 bequeathed the property, in his own occupation and that of Elizabeth and Edmund Filtness, to his grand-daughter Sarah Gorringe, subject to a bequest of \u00a350 to [her sister] Frances. The will was proved at Lewes by the executor John Gorringe on 20 September 1800 and on 26 June 1801 Sarah was admitted to the property, which Weller had surrendered to the use of his will on 29 June 1795 (79, 80) On 12 January 1825 George Buckwell of Friston yeoman, who had married Sarah Gorringe, agreed to sell the property to William Baldock of Buxted yeoman \u00a3500, a sum to be calculated for timber and \u00a350 for underwood, hop-poles and hay (82). On 12 February Benjamin Waters of Eastbourne yeoman and wife Frances released the estate from her legacy which had been paid, with interest, on 21 April 1819 (83,81) and on 8 March requisitions on the abstract of title, drawn for the vendor by S[amuel] Sinnock of Hailsham, were returned by Philcox and Baldock of Burwash for the purchaser; the main question was the deficiency of over five acres between contract and abstract. On 28 March the abstract was considered by Lewis Duval of Lincoln's Inn and in the course of April further evidence as to title obtained, including a deposition by George Inskip of Hailsham labourer that John Shelley of Hailsham common carrier died many years earlier at Hailsham unmarried (84-90). The points at variance between the two firms were again put to Lewis Duval on 25 April, whose opinion produced further evidence, including a measurement of the land and an affidavit by Isaac Fermor of Hadlow Down in Mayfield schoolmaster (91-95) The property was eventually surrendered to Baldock at a court held on 20 June 1825; the purchase price of \u00a3583 15s 9d plus stock was raised by Baldock and his wife Maria by a mortgage to John Burrell Hayley of Brightling clerk and James Philcox of Burwash gent; also charged was another Framfield copyhold, late Gaston's, consisting of a house and land (23a 3r 34p) called Pencost between Hadlow Down and Buxted (96) By an out-of-court surrender on 29 November 1836 William Baldock mortgaged the property to Edward Holmes Baldock of Hanway Street, Oxford Street gent for \u00a3100; Maria Baldock of Walshes was buried on 17 April 1844 at Hadlow Down. On 17 June 1846, Edward Holmes Baldock of 5 Hyde Park Place purchased the property for \u00a3400, \u00a3100 of which discharged the mortgage to the purchaser's late father (97-101). Baldock annotated a note of the 1825 purchase price and his solicitor's bill with comments concerning the fall in the price of timber soon after 1825 On 17 July 1846 William Baldock wrote to the purchaser ensuring him that he would be able to vote in respect of the property since his name (being the same as his father's - 'my poor cousin') is already on the register. He also enclosed a map of the farm (106), drawn on 3 August 1833 by William Bray; the tenant was then Thomas Lidbetter. He also mentions the arrival of 'strong symptoms' of potato disease (102-107) A cottage and land (7a 1r 17p) called The Sash Windows, copyhold of Framfield Manor, purchased by Edward Holmes Baldock, 29 September 1847 The property, held as four tenements, consisted of three separate titles As to a cottage and land (1r) and piece of waste (2a) to which Sarah Dalloway was admitted in 1774 On 7 July 1774 John Start and wife Mary surrendered the property late Baker's to Sarah wife of John Dalloway, who was admitted and received a grant of waste (2a) from the lord, with the consent of the neighbouring owners Thomas Fry and William Isted, to be held by a rent of 8d; she surrendered both tenements to the use of her will (108) As to The Whitelearns (2.5 a new assart), inherited by Sarah Dalloway in 1808 John and Sarah Dalloway were admitted on the surrender of Thomas Baker on 28 September 1768 for the life of the longer liver with remainder to John's heirs; he surrendered to the use of his will. On 23 June 1808 Sarah Dalloway was admitted according to the terms of her husband's will of 20 July 1801, which she had proved at South Malling on 4 June 1808 (113) As to both estates After she had been admitted to the second tenement, Sarah settled all her estate on herself for life with remainder to Fanny wife of Edward Waterman of Piddinghoe yeoman; Sarah's death was presented at a court held on 28 June 1820 and Fanny's on 21 June 1822 at which court her son William Waterman, a minor, was admitted by his father Edward as attorney according to his mother's will of 8 February 1821, proved at Lewes on 23 October 1821 On 15 September 1830 the property was sold by William Waterman, with other land, to Joseph Richardson of Withyham miller for \u00a3512 of which \u00a3250 was raised by mortgage to the vendor, which was paid off on 12 October 1832 (113) As to a grant of waste (3r 31p) to Joseph Richardson in 1833 On 21 June 1833 the lord of Framfield Manor, with the consent of the neighbouring owners Joseph Richardson, Ann Rutley, William Baldock and James Winter, granted a piece of waste at Buxted Wood to Richardson, to be held by a rent a 4d (109) As to the whole estate On 14 January 1845 Joseph Richardson and Elizabeth Goring Richardson his wife mortgaged the property, with other land, to Edward Blaker of Portslade gent for \u00a3600 at 4\u00bd% and on 11 December 1846 sold the first three tenements, subject to the mortgage, to John Foster of Beddington in Surrey for \u00a3630 (113) On 7 July 1847 The Sash Windows, still occupied by Joseph Richardson, was auctioned at the White Hart Buxted along with Dalloway's Farm and two cottages also occupied by Richardson (sold to Mr Collins of Chiddingly for \u00a3500) and a house with a grocer's and draper's shop at Buxted Wood, occupied by Mr Hill (bought in at \u00a3345). The Sash Windows was bought by John Newnham as agent for Edward Holmes Baldock for \u00a3300; he was also offered the draper's shop by the vendor at \u00a3345 but this offer does not seem to have been taken up (110-113). Newnham, writing from Uckfield, announced his purchase to Baldock by a letter of 9 July; he had paid more than he wanted because the prospective tenant of late William Baldock's [74-107 above], W Hope, wanted him to purchase. An abstract, drawn by J and E Blaker of Lewes for the vendor, was examined against the court rolls by the steward, Robert Hoffman Faulconer, on 5 August 1847 and on 6 August the vendors' solicitors wrote answering requisitions and enclosing a plan of the property (113-115) Joseph Richardson and his wife made an out-of-court surrender of the fourth tenemant to John Foster on 21 August 1847 and on 29 September, once the mortgage had been discharged, Baldock was admitted to the tenements by John Newnham his attorney, who settled the solicitor's account the same day (116-121) The day after the purchase Newnham wrote to Baldock explaining that an earlier letter had been addressed to York, where Baldock had been expected to be; Newnham would attend the tenant right valuations of Berwick's [late William Baldock's] and Richardson's [Sash Windows] on Baldock's behalf (122) Cottage at Buxted Wood, copyhold of Framfield Manor, purchased by Edward Holmes Baldock, 10 November 1856 On 7 September 1839 Edward Willett, who held in trust for the parishioners of Buxted, surrendered to William Bennett of Buxted yeoman a house and garden at Buxted Wood in his own occupation; it was part of a tenement in Buxted Wood on which the parish had built another house, which had been sold to John Alchorne, and paid a rent of 1d by apportionment [for this property see 128-134 below]. Bennett was admitted on 17 June 1841 (123) Baldock's agent John Newnham contracted to buy the cottage from Bennett for \u00a365 on 28 October 1856; it was occupied by John Pollard labourer. Baldock was admitted, on the surrender of Bennett and his wife Martha, at a court held on 10 November 1856 (124-127) Pair of cottages and land formerly waste at Buxted Wood, copyhold of Framfield Manor, purchased by Edward Holmes Baldock, 30 June 1858 This property forms the residue of that held in trust by Edward Willett for the parishioners of Buxted, part of which (see 123-127 above) was purchased by Baldock in 1856 On 2 March 1839 the churchwardens and overseers of Buxted joined the Guardians of Uckfield Union and Willett, the copyhold tenant, to convey a house occupied by John Thomas and Henry Ware to John Alchorne of Buxted yeoman for \u00a335. The surrender was made on 11 March and Alchorne was admitted at a court held on 20 June 1839. On 21 June 1843 the lord of Framfield Manor, with the consent of the neighbouring tenants William Baldock, William Bennett and John Alchorne, granted a piece of waste (2r 4p) to Alchorne, to be held at a rent of 3d (128-129) On 18 May 1858 Alchorne agreed with Baldock's agent Charles Newnham of Uckfield for the sale of the property (plan) for \u00a375 but made it clear that he reserved his rights under the imminent enclosure award. Newnham sent the contract to Baldock on 25 May, initially hoping to save money by taking an out-of-court surrender to himself but adding a postscript indicating that the saving of 15s or \u00a31 was not worth making. The vendor, 'Old Alchorne', seems to have resented Baldock's instructing his tenant to pay no more rent to him. On 30 June 1858 the surrender was made by John Alchorne and Frances his wife and the following day, Newnham, addressing the letter 'my dear cousin', enclosed a note of the court fees (130-134) House and land at Buxted Wood, copyhold of Framfield Manor, purchased by Edward Holmes Baldock, 30 October 1860 On 20 June 1806 a house and land (1r) and two other tenements amounting to 1\u00bca, all late Coe's and before Isted's, were surrendered by James Coe to James Winter of Buxted labourer (135) On 19 June 1807, Winter received a grant of waste (1a) from the lord with the consent of John Dalloway, the neighbouring tenant [for the sale of part of this tenement to Richard Winter in 1850 see 171-179 below] and on 22 June 1853 James Winter, Winter's only son, was admitted on his father's death (136, 137) James Winter agreed to sell the house to Edward Holmes Baldock for \u00a3180 on 26 October 1860 and the same day Charles Newnham wrote to Baldock asking for the purchase price and referring to another purchase of land from Colonel Harcourt which, despite its mention on the bundle wrapper, is not represented by any documents. Newnham's reply proposes another purchase, from Mr Field, and also mentions the possibility of the new railway going via Buxted, in which eventuality Mr Baldock may 'be inclined to take a few shares' (138-140) The property was surrendered by James Winter and Louisa his wife on 30 October 1860 and the same day Baldock, noting the purchase, suggested that the rent of \u00a38 a year proposed to be paid by James Winter junior might be increased since the purchase price had been greater than at first contemplated (141-143) Cottage and land (2a 1r 26p) called Jefferys at Buxted Wood, copyhold of Framfield Manor, purchased by Edward Holmes Baldock, 17 March 1862 On 21 April 1757 John Goldsmith, with the consent of Thomas Price the neighbouring owner, was granted four preces of waste (2r 26p) in Buxted Wood. On 2 July 1772 Goldsmith, with Elizabeth his wife, surrendered the property, together with a cottage and land (\u00bda) late Harper's before Puxty's to Sarah Wheatly of Lewes spinster, who was admitted by her attorney Richard Watts of Lewes gent on 13 July 1773; Sarah surrendered the property to the use of her will on 18 September (144-147) On 6 June 1786 Sarah Wheatly surrendered to George Adams of Buxted yeoman and his wife Ann, with remainder to the longer liver and then to Ann's heirs; she, as a widow, surrendered the property to Henry Weller of Buxted yeoman on 27 November 1789; also included was a piece of waste (3/4a) late Fry's. Weller surrendered all his copyhold to the use of his will at a court held on 29 June 1795 (148-150) By his will of 8 April 1799 Henry Weller left this property [for other bequests see 1-7 and 74-104 above] to his daughter Sarah wife of John Gorringe of Buxted innholder, who was admitted at a court held 28 June 1802; the tenant was then James Jeffery. On 25 June 1817 Sarah's husband John Gorringe was admitted for life by virtue of her will of 25 February 1815 with remainder to her daughter Ann Gorringe (156) John Gorringe's death was presented at a court held on 23 June 1821 and his daughter Ann, now wife of Samuel Rutley of Aylesford in Kent yeoman, was admitted by virtue of her mother's will and surrendered to the use of her own (151) On an unspecified date in 1829 Sammuel Rutley paid \u00a33 to the parish highway surveyors for part of Nash's Lane which had been stopped up by order of Quarter Sessions on 20 October 1826 [for which see QRE 789] and in the same year Samuel Rutley drew a small map of Jeffery's tenement which shows the new purchase and identifies its tenure as freehold (152,153) Ann died at Wrotham in Kent on 17 August 1854 and her will of 26 May 1851, bequeathing the estate to Samuel, was presented at a court held on 18 June 1856 and Samuel admitted (154,155) An abstract of Samuel Rutley's title was drawn in January 1862 by George F Carnell of Sevenoaks and the property surrendered out-of-court on 17 March 1862 for \u00a3185; Edward Holmes Baldock, of 31 Grosvenor Place, was admitted at a court held on 19 June (156-164). For Baldock's admission to his late mother's estate at the same court see 165-170 below New House Buxted, inherited by Edward Holmes Baldock on the death of his mother Mary Baldock, to which he was admitted on 19 June 1862 This estate had been settled in 1811 on the marriage of Edward Holmes Baldock with Mary Gorringe, who was given a power of appointment; for details, see 1-7 above At a court held on 19 June 1862 Baldock, by Charles Newnham his attorney, produced the probate of his mother's will dated 29 January 1861 bequeathing the estate to him and was admitted to the tenement and to the land allocated in respect of it by the enclosure award of 21 January 1862 A letter from B[ernard] Husey Hunt of Lewes, the steward of the manor who had acted in both 1862 transactions, indicates that enfranchisement was contemplated (165-170) 'The Spotted Cow', three cottages and land, freehold and copyhold of Framfield Manor, purchased by Edward Holmes Baldock on 29 September 1868 The site of this property formed part of the acre of lord granted by the lord of Framfield Manor to James Winter of Buxted labourer in 1807 (see 136 above). On 13 June 1850 James Winter sold the SE part of the tenement, with a recently erected house and other buildings, to Richard Winter of Buxted beershop keeper and Hannah his wife for \u00a338 (171) As well as being allocated 25 perches in respect of the tenement by the Framfield Manor Enclosure Commissioners, on 21 January 1862 Richard Winter purchased part of the land (1a 1r 18p) set aside to be sold to pay the expenses of enclosure for \u00a326 5s. Richard Winter died 7 November 1863 and on 2 May 1864 his widow Hannah proved his will of 12 Aug 1856, by which the estate passed to her The estate was purchased by Edward Holmes Baldock for \u00a31000 on 29 September 1868. The correspondence makes clear that as well as the beershop, Mrs Winter was tenant of much of Baldock's other land, paying a rent (including \u00a330 for the Spotted Cow) of \u00a375 a year. Baldock's agent Charles Newnham was of the opinion that the beershop should be closed as soon as Mrs Winter left it, but that she should not be evicted - 'I should not at present know where to find a better tenant'; in another letter, he reported the death and funeral arrangements of William Gorringe, possibly Baldock's brother-in-law, at the age of 88 (172-179) The whole estate, 1875-1899 Edward Holmes Baldock died on 15 August 1875 and his will was proved by his son Edward Holmes Baldock and his solicitor John Loxley of Loxley and Morley, 80 Cheapside, on 6 January 1876, who on 14 June 1877 were admitted to the copyhold tenements. The manorial stewards sent the admission, together with a renunciation by three of the executors, to Loxley and Morley on 25 May 1878 (180). Neither document survives with the papers but the enrolment (ADA 131 pp310-324) makes it clear that Baldock's personal estate included large amounts of railway stock In March and April 1878 Edmund John Sinden of Uckfield brewer, acting as agent for the trustees, concluded tenancy agreements (details) with Alfred Eade of Shepherds Hill Farm Framfield farmer (11a 1r 11p at \u00a325), Henry Newnham of the Spotted Cow Farm Buxted farmer (35a 3r 13p at \u00a360), Richard Ralph of Buxted florist (house and 1r at \u00a37) and Samuel Jenner of Pound Green in Buxted farmer (24a 2r 2p at \u00a344 10s), whose lease was taken by Robert Leeves of Pound Green farmer (35a 2r 3p at \u00a360) on 19 September 1879. On 28 September 1887 leases were granted to Henry Coleman of Buxted higgler (house and 1r at \u00a310) and John Bray of Nettlesworth Farm Heathfield farmer (24a 2r 2p at \u00a344 10s); Sinden by that date was of Southover (181-188) On 23 January 1899 Henry Hope Edwards bart, out of the trustees of Baldock's will, applied to the court of Chancery to determine whether the copyhold portion of the estate should be enfranchised before sale, by what means the costs of enfranchisement should be met and how, if the court determined that the estate should be sold with vacant possession, the sums necessary to compensate the sitting tenants might by raised; an order for sale was made by Mr Justice Kekewich in chambers on 20 March 1899 and the estate was enfranchised and sold in course of that year (189-190) Piece of land W of the Buxted-Howbourne Road at Pound Green, purchased by John Charles Buckwell, 17 December 1883 The land was granted under the Framfield enclosure award of 1862 (see 200 below) in reject of a copyhold house and land on the E side of Pound Green, to which the previous title relates. There is no indication that the property formed part of the Baldock estate but it may have been purchased after the date of the last surviving conveyance On 7 July 1775, a piece of land containing 60 rods was granted by the lord of Framfield Manor to Robert Parker of Buxted stonemason with the consent of Catherine Stone widow and Thomas Coe, the neighbouring tenants, to be held as new assart at an annual rent of 1d (191) By 1799 the land, on which a house and buildings had been built, had passed, subject to the dower of Robert Parker's widow Elizabeth Skinner, to Henry Parker. On 24 June his attorney William Bunce of Westerham in Kent surrendered the property to Henry Parker the younger of Wisterham, who surrendered to the use of his will at the same court (192) On 21 June 1805 Henry Parker and his wife Sarah surrendered the property to George Hollands of Buxted shopkeeper; Hollands's will of 29 January 1818, to the use of which he had surrendered the property, was proved in PCC on 9 May 1832 and describes him as a grocer, draper and tailor. On 20 June that year his wife Sarah was admitted to this and other copyhold property (see 20-45 above) for the term of her life (193-195) George Hollands's son John, a draper and grocer, to whom the reversion of the estate had been bequeathed, became bankrupt in 1844; on 17 June the petition of William Gorringe of Buxted farmer was exhibited against him in the court of bankruptcy and on 28 June his estate was assigned to Gorringe and Edward Kennard of Uckfield maltster. On 11 January 1832 John Holland and his mother had borrowed \u00a3800 from Edward Harvey Maltby of the Albany, MX esq in the form of an annuity, secured by a conditional sale of their free and copyhold property in Buxted to Charles Henry Maltby of Quimperle, Finisterre, France Sarah Holland died on 3 August 1845 and on 20 February 1846 the Maltbys released the property from the annuity for a payment of \u00a3834 13s 3d (196,197). The following day the commissioner in bankruptcy joined the assignees (Kenward being described as a wine-merchant) to sell the copyhold house, stable and land at Buxted Wood to James Field of Adelaide Place London Bridge architect for \u00a3200; William Crowe of Uckfield solicitor, who had drawn many of the bankruptcy documents, witnessed the conveyance on behalf of the assignees. On 17 June Field was admitted at a court held for the manor of Framfield by his attorney Benjamin Hall (198,199) The Commissioners for the enclosure of Framfield Manor confirmed the valuer's award on 30 January 1862. James Field was awarded two pieces of land in respect of his copyhold; a plan shows all three parcels (200) On 2 December 1881 Field, of Sandgate in Kent esq, sold the property to William Whiteman of 6 West View Terrace, Hove, builder for \u00a3180. Whiteman was admitted at a court held on 10 January 1882 and enfranchised the holding on 31 March for \u00a326 10s (210-203) On 30 November 1883 Whiteman sold the smaller of the two awarded parcels, which fronted on Howbourne Road, to Kate wife of John Henry Gardner of Hove, builder's merchant, for \u00a350, who on 17 December 1883 sold to John Charles Buckwell of Brighton gent for \u00a360; the abstract, but not the conveyance, describes the plot as a house and land (204-207) Grant of land to John Jenner, 28 December 1756 This copy of court roll of Framfield Manor, granting three fields, a garden and close with a barn (2a 12p) to John Jenner whose land it adjoined on the N, does not form part of any of the titles listed above. If the tenement is followed through the court books (ADA 118-133), the descent of the property to the Harcourt family via John Gorringe victualler (admitted 1786), John Newnham brewer (admitted 1829), William Baxter of Lewes tanner (admitted 1842) and William Wheatley yeoman (admitted 1847) can be traced. Gorringe was the (see 1-7 above), Newnham acted as his agent (see 116-121 above) and in 1860 a purchase of land from Colonel Harcourt, for which no deeds survive, was mentioned in a letter (see 138-143 above). This document could derive from any of these relationships or may be a stray from a later purchase (208)",

Settlements and Personal Estate Papers (MSS. 653-737). An incomplete series, most noteworthy for the documents preceding the marriage of Sir John Trevor Ii and Anne Hampden in 1619. The Fitton settlements (MSS. 694-737) should be studied with reference to the Fitton letters (see above Correspondence). They disclose the indebtedness of Sir Edward Fitton to his brother-in-law Sir John Trevor II. Testamentary Records (MSS. 738-747). No earlier original wills than those of John Trevor III and Richard Trevor (both of 1589) survive, but the group also includes that of Edmund Hampden, 1605. Miscellaneous (MSS. 748-759) includes a letter from Henry Earl of Arundel (1589) of parliamentary interest, papers concerning a church in Anglesey (1639), tapestry (1645-53) and the affairs of Sir Vincent Corbett's trustees. LATER TREVOR AND BRAND FAMILIES Pedigrees (MSS. 760-762) include a printed work showing the ownership of Glynde Place with a note on the portraits. Personal Papers (MSS. 763-771). Apart from two midshipmen's logbooks kept by Thomas Seymour Brand and Humphrey Ranulph Brand, little falls into this class. Parliamentary Elections (MSS. 772-793) consist of vouchers and some correspondence for the Lewes elections of 1741, 1768 and 1774 when Trevors stood as candidates. Correspondence: Hampden family (MSS. 794-796). A group of papers whose unexpected appearance among the Glynde MSS. may be explained by the relationship of Sir John Trevor III, through his mother and his wife, to that family (see pedigree p.xxvi) and by the subsequent inheritance of the Buckinghamshire estates of the Hampdens by Robert 4th Lord Trevor in 1754. They include unsigned letters of Algernon Sidney, written during his captivity in the Tower and his trial for treason in 1683, probably to his fellow prisoner John Hampden; three interesting letters of Thomas, afterwards 1st Marquis of Wharton, to Richard Hampden on Buckinghamshire elections, 1704-1714; and a letter of Richard Hampden perhaps to the Duchess of Kendal about his speculation in the South Sea Company, 1720. Settlements and Testamentary Records (MSS. 797-844). This is an incomplete series, but includes exemplifications of proceedings in Chancery on the wills of John Trevor IV, 1689, and John Trevor V, 1744. There are no original or probate copies of Brand wills. GLYNDE PLACE Building, Maintenance and Furnishing (MSS. 845-884). Considerable alterations and repairs to the Tudor mansion were carried out when Bishop Richard Trevor was owner, 1743-1771, and it is for this period alone that any records on this subject survive. They include two designs for the new stables, some sketches and notes on building materials and work one by glaziers, painters, carpenters and bricklayers. Reference should also be made to the household vouchers and estate accounts of the period. Household Accounts (MSS. 885-907). Detailed vouchers survive for 1753-1769 only. Hawksden, late 13th century, are followed by leases, 1394-1727 (MSS. 1223-1234). The exception to this rule are the leases of the Glynde bourne farms by the Trevors and Brands. These farms being made up of several properties purchased at different times have been grouped on their (MSS. 1898-1919). Waleys family properties (MSS. 1142-1346) SUSSEX Glynde: Various, pre 1290-1410 (MSS. 1142-1198). Chambers, 1472-1555 (MSS. 1199, 1200). Heathfield: Stonhurst, pre 1264-1305 (MSS. 1201-1204).

Ardeley and La More manor, 1303-1374 (MSS. 1270-1280). Aspenden and Wakeley manors, 12th cent.-1553 (MSS. 1281-1313). Buntingford, 1415 (MS. 1314). Cottered, 1282, 1343 (MSS. 1315, 1316).

A small group, of which a catalogue of fruit trees sent to Glynde Place, 1754, a list of ten family portraits, 1760, and an inventory of the goods of John, [3rd] Viscount Hampden are the only items of importance. Correspondence (MSS. 917-920) being 4 letters on the pictures at Glynde. GLYNDE CHURCH Papers concerning the rebuilding (MSS. 922-953) carried out by Bishop Trevor 1763-5, include sketches and measurements by John Morris of Lewes, the contractor, but no designs by the architect, Sir Thomas Robinson. Reference should also be made to the household and estate accounts for the period. MANORIAL RECORDS (MSS. 954-1138). These are prefaced by an important group dealing with the relations of the lords of Glynde with their overlords, the Archbishops of Canterbury, and also with the tenure of Buxted manor. The late 12th century list of knights of the archbishop (MS. 954) is of outstanding importance. Other items include a rental of South Malling manor in 1305/6, a custumal of that manor, papers concerning disputes with the overlord of Glynde in 1465 and 1669-70, and between the lords of Glynde and Buxted in 1613. The records of only seven of the Sussex manors which formed part of the estate have survived among the archives. Of these Glynde and Baynden were Waleys manors, Beddingham, Combe and Preston Beckhelwyn were bought by the Morleys while Horsted Keynes and Bivelham were added by the Trevors and Brands respectively. No records survive in the archives for the Waleys manor of Patching or the sub-manor of Hawkesden in Mayfield, or of Thanington in Kent. The manor of Beddingham has the best run of court rolls, 1331-1901, with some gaps, together with nine compotus rolls, 1307-1391. For Glynde a broken series of court rolls, 1336-1901, survive but with detailed rentals of which the earliest are c. 1290, 1298-9 and 1353. Also in this class are a few records of the manors of Moor Hall in Ardeley, Dynesle Temple and Farnyvale in Preston, and the manor of Bussheton in Pirton, Hertfordshire, all believed to be Waleys manors. Some stray West Country manorial records, having no known connection with these archives, have been placed in the Miscellanea (MSS.3471, 3472). TITLE DEEDS AND LEASES The Waleys Cartulary (MSS. 1139-1141). For a detailed introduction to this private register of Waleys title deeds referring to Hertfordshire, Hampshire and Sussex, 13th century-1419, see the catalogue. MSS. 1140 and 1141 are paper rolls of copies of medieval deeds, c. 1290-1344. The individual deeds have been arranged under the families which acquired them and this follows the existing arrangement on deposit. It also allows the student to see the growth of the estate around the medieval nucleus. Within each group the deeds are arranged alphabetically by parish and within the parish group the various properties are placed in chronological order of the earliest title deed, which does not necessarily follow the order of acquisition by the lords of Glynde. Following immediately each group of title deeds have been placed later leases giving a full account of each property in the estate.

It stands at the head of the village street which runs south to Glynde Reach, a tributary of the River Ouse. No full scale parish history of Glynde has yet appeared, though there is an extensive article on the subject by the Rev. W. de St. Croix. ' From the 12th century to the present day four related families, the Waleys, Morleys, Trevors and Brands, have lived at Glynde and contributed to the archives listed in this volume. The classification of these archives has attempted to preserve as far as possible the original groups of personal papers, settlements and wills under four headings: Waleys, Morley, Early Trevor, Later Trevor and Brand. The Trevor division is to distinguish the documents of the family brought with them from Wales when they inherited the estate in 1679 from those accumulated in Sussex. The title deeds have been divided to show the build up of the estate by these families and under each family these are arranged topographically. The Welsh deeds of the Trevors form a separate section here. A more detailed grouping of these records will be found in the table of contents, while the more important items in each group are noted in the summary of the classes on p. 1 below. A brief account of each family with a pedigree follows, while introductions to the more important groups of records such as the Waleys Cartulary and the Sea Coal Farm papers will be found preceding their notice in the catalogue. Finally a note of related archives elsewhere appears on p. 8. THE WALEYS FAMILY The first-known lord of Glynde was Richard Waleys I, who was holding four knights fees of the Archbishop of Canterbury at Glynde and Buxted in Sussex, Thanington and Lossenham in Kent according to a late twelfth century list of knights of the archbishop. Waleys (Walensis) was a common name meaning 'of Wales' or simply 'foreign' and it will be appreciated that in the century after the Norman Conquest it would be hazardous to attempt a pedigree on surname evidence alone. Richard's father may have been the Robert Waleys who witnessed a notification to the barons of Kent in 1161-8, paid 40s. with Ralph, the clerk, for the lands of his brother William to the Sheriff of Kent in 1163-4, and owned land in Little Horsted in c. 1170. The first mention of Richard Waleys I is on the Sussex portion of the Pipe Roll, 1178-9, for the payment of 10 marks for his right to I fee in Torinton (? Taninton, i.e., Thanington, Kent). Richard married a certain Denise, who is called 'the heiress of the Lord Glynde' in the old family pedigree. This old tradition that Glynde was inherited through an heiress may be based on fact in spite of the unreliability of the pedigrees, which all postdate Richard and Denise to the end of the thirteenth century. There are good reasons for supposing that the lords of Glynde before the Waleys were descended from one Godfrey of Malling, of whom Domesday Book records that he had previously held the manor of South Malling to farm for 90 pounds and was still holding a hide worth 50 shillings of the archbishop in the same manor (this may have been in Glynde which was in the Archbishop's peculiar of South Malling and is not mentioned elsewhere in Domesday Book). The Domesday Monachorum of Christchurch, Canterbury, notes that Godfrey of Malling held 3 fees of the archbishop. Professor Douglas has doubted whether Godfrey of Malling was identical with a Godfrey the dapifer holding land at Thanington, just outside Canterbury, but in view of the possession of the manor of Thanington and property in the peculiar of South Malling by the Waleys it may well be that the two Godfreys were one person, the ancestor of the heiress Denise. The popularity of Godfrey as a Christian name for Waleys men favours this argument. Denise remarried Ralph Ardern and in 1209/10 they conveyed by fine the manors of Glynde, [West] Tarring and Patching in Sussex, Thanington and Newenden in Kent, which Denise held by grant of Archbishop Hubert Walter (d. 1205) possibly as her dower, to Denise's son Godfrey Waleys I, in exchange for a life interest in Patching for Ralph. Sir Godfrey Waleys I was credited with service of 1\u00bc knights' fees for West Tarring, one of the archbishop's Sussex manors, in 1210-12; by 1233 he was farming the manor for an annual render of 181i. in money or in food dues when the archbishop stayed at his mansion of West Tarring. About this time he appears as witness to several St. Pancras Priory deeds and in one is called 'the steward of the hall of Lewes.' Archbishop Edmund Rich deprived Godfrey of the manor for making default in rent but restored it in 1237 on payment over four years of \u00a380, which the Archbishop graciously deposited with the Prior of Lewes to provide marriage portions for Godfrey's four daughters. His grandson Richard Waleys II was forced to relinquish the manor in 1276 for wronging the tenants and spending only 61i. 17s. 5\u00bed. on food for dues on one of Archbishop Robert Kilwardby's visits. The suit made a great stir in the county and 'all the knights and free tenants of Sussex were challenged on one side or the other.' Richard was obliged to quitclaim his right of chase in the archbishop's manors of South Malling and Mayfield. In 1235 Sir Godfrey Waleys I was nominated a collector of the lay aid granted on the marriage of Isabella, the daughter of Henry III, with the Emperor Frederick II. When the money was rendered at the Exchequer in 1237 Godfrey was dead and his son Godfrey was represented by H[ugh] de Albeigny who held him in ward. Sir Godfrey Waleys II married Joan, the daughter of Robert le Sauvage. In a case recorded on the Assize Roll for 52 Henry III (1267-8) it was stated that Godfrey had died about a year before, leaving a son Richard and a daughter Agnes de Baddebyr. His widow Joan had then come to Shipley in Sussex and given Agnes seisin, but the same evening Richard, son of Godfrey, came and turned her out so the seisin was not effective. In 1271 Joan Waleys levied a fine with Agnes de Baddebyr of the manor of Goringlee in Sussex. Sir Richard II compensated for his loss of West Tarring by buying lands at Carleham, Hawkesden and Baynden in Mayfield and he did homage to the archbishop for lands in Mayfield in 1279. His estates now included woodland at Mayfield, down at Patching, and down, arable, and brookland at Glynde. In Kent, Thanington lay near the west gate of Canterbury while at Newenden and Lossenham, a small port in the lower Rother valley, Sir Richard commanded the road from London to Rye, and the heavy tolls he exacted at Newenden bridge were much resented by the men of Rye, who in revenge distrained on his tenants in 1281. Sir Richard married Joan, daughter of Thomas Gates of Newenden, and had two sons Richard and Godfrey. His widow had remarried Robert de Sevaunz (or Septvans) by 1294 without royal licence. Sir Richard Waleys III was enrolled for the defence of the realm in 1296, and in 1297, 1298 and 1301 he was summoned to fight in Edward l's Scots War. Meanwhile his brother Godfrey was living at Thanington and taking the profits there and at Lossenham to his own use. On his brother's death without issue Sir Godfrey inherited and on 13 October 1303 rendered homage to the archbishop for 3 knights fees at Glynde, Buxted, Thanington and Lossenham. He too fought against the Scots in the Bannockburn campaign in 1314 and in 1324 he was summoned to the Great Council in Westminster. The facts of Sir Godfrey's two marriages were bitterly disputed by his descendants in a fifteenth century law suit and it is still impossible to verify this part of the Waleys pedigree. The supporters of William Waleys III believed that Sir Godfrey's sons John, William, Thomas and Godfrey were children of his first marriage with the daughter of Sir Herre [Henry] Tregoz, and that Sir Godfrey remarried in 1305 Joan, the daughter of Sir John Bassingbourn, by whom he had no children. The four co-heiresses and their husbands on the other hand claimed descent from Joan Bassingbourn in order to inherit under the entail of 1305 It was alleged by the first party that Sir John Waleys must have been the son of Godfrey's first marriage and born before 1305 as he was a hundred years old when he died in 1375 'as yt ys welknowen to gret partie of the schyre of Sussex.' This reckoning was based Waleys III, son of William Waleys II, brother of John Waleys II. This William is called the Idiot in the family pedigree. Robert, [5th] Baron Poynings appears to have had the wardship of William the idiot (wronGLY/called John in MS. 8) and to have occupied the manor of Glynde by agreement with Henry Chichele, Archbishop of Canterbury. As a natural idiot one would have expected William to have been in the king's wardship. The four daughters and their husbands disputed the tile of William Waleys III and the dispute was put to the arbitration of William Chaunterell, serjeant-at-law, and Alexander Anne, recorder of the City of London. In their award of 22 Nov. 1436 the arbiters found for the four daughters, and Lord Poynings was ordered to surrender the manor; William Waleys was disseised on 12 Dec. 1436. The coheirs then partitioned the Waleys estates. Beatrice and her second husband William Milreth, took the manors of Hawkesden and Baynden, half the mill of Mellynk and part of the manor of Glynde. The Manor of Patching, half the mill of Mellynk, and an annuity of 26s. 8d. were allotted to Agnes and John Burgh. The manor of Glynde was to be held jointly by Robert Lee and his wife Joan and Nicholas Morley and his wife Joan, a decision that was to cause much contention, and was taken to arbitration in 1440. There is no information in the archives about the partition of the other Waleys estates and no more is heard of the Kent manors of Lossenham and Thanington and the 'vill' of Newenden. The lands in Shalden, co. Hants., brought by Margaret, the de Boys heiress, to the de Kendales and ultimately to the Waleys, seem to have gone to the Lee family for their deeds show they resided there. Nicholas Morley, a prominent Hertfordshire gentleman, obtained most of the Hertfordshire lands including the manors of Wakely, Tanneys, Aspenden and Moor Hall in Ardeley. The manor of Beauchamps alias Alfladewick, co. Herts., was in the possession of Agnes with her first husband, John Burgh, in 1434, and with her second husband, John Padyngton, in 1452. In 1445/6 the claim of William Waleys III to the inheritance was again asserted and an Inquisition was held on the 14 March 1445/6 by the king's escheator which found that William Waleys III was the next male heir and that he had been an idiot from birth and still was an idiot. MS. GLY/23 relates that on 14 April the coparceners instituted proceedings in Chancery for the recovery of the lands. MS. GLY/14 though dated 4 Nov. 1450, was originally dated 14 April 1446 and records the case probably heard on the Common Law side of Chancery between the coparceners and John Vampage for the king. The coparceners claimed that they were heirs general to two parts of the manor of Glynde by the fine of 1305. The other third was held in dower by Joan, widow of Sir Richard Waleys III. The parties were at issue as to whether Sir John Waleys I was the son of Godfrey Waleys by on the curious premise that as Sir John was bedridden for more than a year before he died he must have been more than 69 (if born in 1305) 'for he was a sclendre mane and also lusty a knyght in ys dayes as was any of ys age wythine the reyme of Ingelond.' More rational proofs for Sir John's age were his homages for the Kentish manors in 1315 and 1318 recorded in 'the gret booke of fees' of the archbishop. He must have been at least in his eighties when he died. This lusty knight was a member of the retinue of Michael, Lord Poynings, in the Crecy-Calais campaign of 1346-7. His venerable age and military reputation made him a man of standing in Sussex; he was sheriff of Sussex and Surrey in 1364 and sat as knight of the shire in the parliaments from 1368-71. Sir John married twice and had two sons Andrew and William by his first wife Nicholas, daughter of Sir Andrew Medestede of West Firle, and two sons Hugh and Richard by his second wife, Alice Aspale. Andrew died soon after his return from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1378 and his brother William inherited the Waleys estates. Richard, the surviving son of Sir John's second marriage, received his mother's Aspale properties in Devonshire and founded a new branch of the family in that county. Sir William Waleys I represented Sussex as knight of the shire in the parliaments of 1380, 1382/3, 1387/8 and 1390; he was twice sheriff of Surrey and Sussex in 1383 and 1395. His wife Margaret, daughter of Sir John St. Clere, Chief Forester of Ashdown Forest to John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, survived him and received her dower from her son John Waleys II in, 1409. John Waleys II was the only lord of Glynde among his family not to achieve knighthood; he fought as an esquire under the banner of Thomas, Earl of Arundel, in the Agincourt campaign in 1415. Yet his was the most successful marriage of his line. His wife Joan Turk, whose father Sir Robert Turk had been a wealthy citizen and grocer of London, had inherited through her mother Beatrice the De Kendale and De Boys properties in Hertfordshire and Hampshire. The Waleys did not survive long to enjoy this fortunate addition to their estates. John Waleys II died in 1418 and his young son John Waleys III died within age leaving the inheritance to be disputed over and divided between his four sisters and their nearest male relations. THE DIVISION OF THE WALEYS ESTATE IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY John Waleys II, esq., died on 4 Oct. 1418 leaving a son John III, who inherited the estates, and four daughters, Beatrice, the wife of Reginald Cokayn, Joan, then wife of Robert Leventhorp, of Sawbridgeworth, co. Herts., Agnes, then wife of John Burgh of London, and Joan, who married Nicholas Morley of Aspenden, co. Herts. John Waleys III died before he reached his majority. The next male heir was his cousin William his wife Joan Bassingbourn, named in the fine, or by a first wife, the daughter of Sir Henry Tregoz. Both the parties were confused about the pedigree of the Waleys family. The coparceners claimed to inherit also under the grants made by Sir William Waleys I to his son John Waleys II of the Manors of Glynde, Hawkesden, Baynden and Patching in 1398. William Waleys III claimed as next heir male to his cousin John Waleys III under a deed of 26 April 1378 whereby the feoffees of Sir John Waleys I, confirmed the manors to Giles de Wrynglesworthe and John Sadeler for two years with remainders to Andrew Waleys and his brothers William, Hugh and Richard successively in tail male. This deed was executed during the absence of Andrew Waleys on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. This series of deeds presents difficulties as Wrynglesworth and Sadeler surrendered the manors to Andrew Waleys in Easter 1378, the very month when the confirmation for two years had been made. It may be that the deeds of 26 April and 29 April 1378 were made to supply the absence of original deeds and were executed after Sir John Waleys' death in 1375/6. The coparceners objected to the entail of 26 April 1378 on the grounds that the granting clause in the form of confirmavimus was insufficient in law to create the entail and that the deed lacked seals. The award of 1436 had found for the coparceners on these grounds. The extant deed, Glynde MS. GLY/4, is obviously a copy perhaps made in the middle of the 15th century. The case was transferred in 1446 to the judgment of Noleweton and Cheke, Justices of the Common Pleas, and they with other judges heard the case at St. Andrew, Holborn, and at Whitefriars. A report was then given to the Chancellor who found for William Waleys III. On 4 July 1446, the king granted the custody of the manors to Sir John Fortescue by reason of the idiocy of William Waleys. Sir John was to maintain William in food, clothing and other necessaries as a gentleman. On 6 November 1451 a new grant of custody was made to John Boeff, John More, John Holeway, Stephen Hoper, William Boeff, Richard Gore and John Blancombe. The coparceners seem to have revived the case in Chancery on 4 November 1450, and most of the surviving case papers belong to the period 1450-55. The case appears to have been committed out of Chancery for hearing by arbiters. No award of arbitration is extant but a later case in the Chancery records states that 'by mediacion of their frendys' it was agreed that William Waleys III and his heirs male should have the whole manor of Glynde in satisfaction of his interest in the estate and that the four sisters and their heirs should have the manors of Hawkesden, Baynden and Patching. The De Banco Roll for Hilary 34 Hen. VI m. 132 (1455/6) records that the coparceners suffered a recovery of the manors of Hawkesden and Baynden against William Waleys III. A charter enrolled on m. 513 records the pedigrees of the two parties and recites a fine of Michaelmas 1455 whereby William Waleys III settled Glynde, Millynke Mill and 2a. land in Ringmer to the uses of himself and his heirs male with remainder to John Waleys IV of Devon. In 1457 a second fine to the same effect was levied. Some time between 1457 and 1460 William Waleys died, and John Waleys IV entered the manor of Glynde and sold it to Nicholas Morley [MSS. 28-35]. Robert Lee refused to recognise Morley's possession of the whole manor; he had enfeoffed Thomas Boleyn, clerk, with his share of the manor before the whole was restored to William Waleys III and he brought a case in Chancery claiming that Thomas should make a feoffment to new feoffees to the uses of Lee and his wife. Nicholas Morley entered a bill supporting his claim to the manor. The records of this case do not survive among the Glynde MSS. but are in the Public Record Office. The case was evidently transferred out of Chancery to the arbitration of Richard Chekke, Justice of the Common Pleas. He judged that Nicholas Morley should have the manor and Robert Lee and his heirs an annual rent charge of \u00a38. 6s. 8d. from it. A dispute arose over the rent charge in 1497-8 and was taken to arbitration. Finally, in 1544, Thomas Morley purchased the reversion of the rent charge from Richard Lee for \u00a3120, though the rent charge which was held for life by William Kingeswell and his wife Elizabeth did not expire until the death of the latter in 1568. The papers in the collection show that it was well over 100 years before the Morleys succeeded in extinguishing the rights of all other claimants to the manor of Glynde. THE MORLEY FAMILY The principal Waleys estates at Glynde and Mayfield were acquired by Nicholas Morley (1410- ?1474), a younger son of Francis Morley, a Lancashire gentleman, by marriage with Joan Waleys, one of the four daughters of John Waleys II, esq. Nicholas Morley was one of the principal gentlemen of Hertfordshire, a standing that was probably conferred on him by his marriage which brought him the Waleys estates in Aspenden, Ardeley and Westmill. He sat as M.P. for the shire in 1435, 1437, 1442, 1445-6, and acted as Justice of the Peace for Hertfordshire, 1435-7, 1451, 1457, 1461-4; escheator, 1439-40; sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire 1442-3. In 1449 and 1450 he was retained with 20 men at arms for service in France. Nicholas appears to have been unscrupulous and tenacious in asserting his rights--perhaps necessary in the fifteenth century for the founder of a new family--but these characteristics brought him into conflict with his overlord the Archbishop of Canterbury and even with a group of tenants of his manor of Glynde who 'of theyr owen untrue ymaginacion amonges them' he complained, 'y hadde confedered and knytte ymaginying to the dysheryte the seyd Nicholas and Johanne.' His quarrel with Sir John Fortescue, the Lancastrian Chief Justice of the King's Bench, (?1394-?1476, see D.N.B.) may have provided a personal reason for his support of the Yorkist cause. Sir John Fortescue, as guardian of William Waleys III, opposed the efforts of Morley's wife and her sisters to win Glynde, and Morley's opponents accused him of slandering Sir John 'upon the Blakehethe to the ryght grete perell of suche as wer better thanne they both and also whate he said agenst him at Baldoke in Hertfordchire in the feire tyme ther the last somyre to the gret perell and lykely oundoynge of the same Sir John and god hadde not defended hym.' In 1461 Morley was active in support of the Yorkist cause in Hertfordshire and the neighbouring counties where he had been commissioned to call together the king's lieges and purvey horses. Towards the end of his life he interested himself in his Sussex estates and represented Bramber as M.P. 1453-4, Shoreham, 1460-1, and East Grinstead, 1467, and was Justice of the Peace for the county from 1463 till his death some time between 1472 and 1474. His descendants, the Morleys of Glynde, seem to have lacked the ambition and good fortune to rise above the class of the small county gentry; they were satisfied with executing the duties of justice of the peace and sheriff for which they were fitted by rank, and occasionally representing Sussex boroughs in Parliament. Unlike the Trevors they never enjoyed the patronage of great nobles; their fortunes, not supplemented by the profits of office, were based solely on land and the iron industry. Robert Morley, son of Nicholas Morley, was sheriff of Surrey and Sussex in 1488. His first wife may have been Mary Cawood who occurs in most of the older pedigrees but the wife named in his will in 1514 was Alice, daughter of Richard Warham, widow of John Barrett by whom she had a child Jane. Robert died in 1516 leaving elaborate instructions in his will for founding a chantry in the chapel of St. John in Glynde church and for 'a Tombe of Marble to be made, with my picture and my armes garnisshid thereon..' where the Easter sepulchre stood. It has been suggested that his eldest son Thomas contracted an irregular marriage with his half-sister Jane by whom he had a daughter Dorothy. A second marriage with Catherine, daughter of Thomas Pelham of Laughton was more propitious for it linked the Morleys with a distinguished neighbouring family. Thomas died during his father's lifetime leaving an infant son Thomas, who after a long minority came of age in 1531 to find his inheritance threatened by a powerful neighbour Sir John Gage, K.G., Vice Chamberlain to the King (1479-1565, see D.N.B.). Thomas petitioned the King against Gage who was laying claim to the manor of Glynde, distraining upon his tenants and 'yntendying with contynuall sute in the law soo to Wery your seyd Subiect that he shalbe dryven to relynquyshe hys lawfull tytle yn the premysses' and the danger was averted. The Morleys took part in the boom in the wealden iron industry in the mid-sixteenth century. Thomas Morley built a forge in Hawkesden Park in Mayfield and in 1548/9 he reported with other commissioners on iron mills in Hastings rape. The only one of his successors to engage directly in the trade was Anthony, his second son; the later Morleys evidently preferred to lease Hawkesden forge to other iron masters. The Glynde estate was consolidated by William Morley, who succeeded his father Thomas in 1559; he purchased the manors of Combe and Beddingham (to the south of Glynde Reach) from Edward, Lord Wyndsor in 1562/3 and sold the Hertfordshire manors to Edward Halfhide in 1568 and 1574. William Morley has been credited with the building of the Elizabethan stone-and-flint mansion of Glynde Place, probably on the site of the earlier house. A doorway in the quadrangle bears his arms and initials and the date 1569. William was sheriff for Surrey and Sussex in 1580, and contributed \u00a360 to the defence of the realm in 1588. His loyalty to the Government was commended in a certificate concerning Sussex Justices, 1587, in which he was described with Thomas Pelham and John Selwyn as 'good justices, as well in respect of religion as of the commonwealth.' He married twice; his first wife Ann, daughter of Anthony Pelham of Buckstepe in Warbleton had died by 1569 leaving him a son Harbert and three daughers. Mary, one of the daughters, married John Hay of Herstmonceux, and took as her jointure Glyndebourne, to be the seat of the Hays for the next two centuries. His second wife was Margaret, daughter of William Robarts of Warbleton by whom he had four more children, Robert, Anthony and Henry and a daughter Margaret. Harbert, the eldest son, sat as M.P. for Winchelsea in 1588 and 1592/3; in 1607 he acted as sheriff for the country. He was master of Glynde from 1597 to 1610 when he died leaving two young daughters --Margaret, who married Sir Humphry Tufton of Maidstone, Kent, bart., and Chrisogon, who married Richard Tufton of Shorne, Kent. Harbert had devised his lands to his half brother Robert Morley with a proviso that the latter was to pay \u00a33,000 each to Chrisogon and Margaret. Robert managed to pay off the portions by mortgaging his estate to the Tuftons and including his two nieces in the entail of the Glynde estate in 1617. The Tufton claim was effectively barred by a recovery suffered by Harbert Morley in 1648. Robert Morley married in 1614, Susanna, daughter and heiress of Thomas Hodgson, of Framfield. The career of Robert Morley reflects the gradual alienation of many of the loyal country gentry by the Stuart expedients of government. He sat in the parliaments of 1620 and 1623/4 as member for Bramber and in 1627/8 as member for Shoreham. He opposed the loan in 1621 and the composition for knighthood in 1629, but it is probable that he assisted in enforcing martial law in 1627 in his capacity as justice of the peace. The year before his death in 1632 he was sheriff for Surrey and Sussex. His son Harbert, then aged 16, became a royal ward. The historian of the Civil War in Sussex was of the opinion that 'Colonel Harbert Morley of Glynde was perhaps the man of greatest influence in the county during this period and his vigilance and activity on behalf of the Parliamentary cause were unceasing throughout the war.' It is unfortunate that none of his personal papers survive among the Glynde MSS. to add any information to previous accounts of his career. He was educated at the Free School, Lewes, at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and finally at the Inner Temple. A little before the dissolution of the Short Parliament he was elected M.P. for Lewes and he sat for the borough in the Long Parliament, remaining in the Rump till its expulsion in 1653. As a colonel in the parliamentary army and deputy lieutenant of Sussex he raised men and money and procured gunpowder for the defence of the county. He was officially thanked by parliament for his share in the fighting at the siege of Chichester and the recapture of Arundel in 1643, over which he was set in command with Sir William Springett of Ringmer. His religious opinions may have resembled those of his friend and neighbour Springett who 'declined bishops and common prayer very early.' Morley was for a short time a member of the Assembly of Divines in 1643 and his opponents accused him of harsh treatment of the ejected royalist clergy and termed him 'the crooked rebel of Sussex.' Although Morley was nominated one of the judges at the trial of Charles I, he refused to sign the death warrant. On 20 February 1650 he became a member of the Council of State. With his friend Sir Arthur Hesilrige [Haselrig] (d. 1661 see D.N.B.) he opposed Cromwell as long as he dared and after the expulsion of the Rump in 1653 he withdrew into private life, refusing to sit in the parliaments of 1654 and 1656. William Goffe (d. 1679?, see D.N.B.), Major General for Sussex in 1655, was uneasy at the influence Colonel Morley still possessed in his county where he had 'ruled the rost, by the help of a disaffected party, much to the griefe of the honest party.' Morley had promised his assistance as justice of the peace but refused to act as a commissioner and Goffe reported that his brother in law John Fagg(e) 'will not stir a hair's breadth without Col. Morley.' In 1659 Morley re-entered parliament as member for Sussex and was now active in debates, speaking against the revived House of Lords and the Dutch war. He was appointed to the Council of State in May and in October was with Hesilrige one of the commissioners for the army. The Commissioners were appointed to guard against the danger of military violence from John Lambert (1619-83, see D.N.B.), who on 13 October 1659 marched on the Parliament. Morley's regiments defended Westminster Palace and the Abbey and Westminster Hall. Lambert marched with his troops to the Palace yard and 'there Morley met him and bid his stand. Morley had a pistol in his hand, and Lambert going as if he intended to have gone into the Hall, Morley swore 'if he stirred a foot further he would shoot him.' To this Lambert answered 'Colonel Morley, I will go another way, though if I please I could pass this.' He turned away and succeeded inoccupying the Parliament House from another entry.' This is the most revealing incident in Morley's career he was ready to risk his life in the defence of Parliament. Morley, Hesilrige and Valentine Walton (d. 1661?, see D.N.B.) retired to Portsmouth which they captured, returned to London and restored parliament. On 2 January 1660 a new Council of State was set up but Morley and Fagg, although elected, refused to take the oath abjuring the house of Stuart and promising fidelity to the Commonwealth and never became members. Morley was appointed Lieutenant of the Tower on 7 January 1659/60 which virtually gave him command of London. John Evelyn, the diarist, blamed Colonel Morley, his old schoolfellow, for failing to take the opportunity of restoring Charles II before this was done by General Monck and when in 1660 Morley had to procure his pardon at a cost of \u00a31,000, Evelyn wrote 'O the sottish omission of this gentleman! what did I not undergo of danger in this negotiation to have brought him over to his Majesty's interest, when it was entirely in his hands!' Evelyn misunderstood the motives of Morley, whose first loyalty lay with his commander General Monck. Mr. E. S. de Beer, the editor of Evelyn's diary, has rehabilitated Morley's reputation and considers that 'In sub-ordinating himself to Monck, Morley appears to have adopted a course at once the wisest in his private interest and the most beneficial to the public welfare.' While his brother-in-law John Fagg obtained a baronetcy at the Restoration, Morley did nothing to ingratiate himself with the new regime. After being deprived of the Tower and his regiments he retired to Glynde and although he was elected M.P. for Rye it is unlikely that he ever sat in the Pension Parliament. Harbert Morley married Mary, the daughter of Sir John Trevor II on 27 October 1648 at St. Peter Westcheap, London. By this marriage the Morleys joined the group of parliamentarian families--the Hampdens, Dentons, Winwoods and Wenmans--which were also related to the Trevors. Harbert died in 1667 at the age of 52 and his eldest son Robert died in 1670 leaving his only surviving brother William, then a minor, heir to Glynde. In 1671 William married Elizabeth, daughter of George Clerke, citizen and grocer of London; she brought him a portion of \u00a36,000 and he agreed to settle a jointure of \u00a3800 annual value on her when he reached his majority. William and Elizabeth had a daughter Anna baptised 18 January 1677/8. William fell sick of smallpox in May 1679 during his attendance at the Commons as M.P. for Lewes. He is reported to have said to Dame Anna Dethick 'It was strange grandmother that I should give instructions for the making of my will on Fryday and should fall sick on the Sunday.' He died on 20 May 1679 at the house of Mr. Farmer in Threadneedle Street, London, having bequeathed by his will (15 May 1679, proved 31 May), his estate to his young daughter Anna, then to his wife Elizabeth for life with remainder to his cousin John Trevor IV. Immediately, on 30 May 1679, John Trevor filed a bill in Chancery against Elizabeth Morley, Anna Morley, Sir John Fagg and Mary his wife, to prevent their contesting the will and to rebutt their allegations that there were 'diverse ill and undue meanes used in and about the procuring and obtayning the said pretended writing' and that the testator was not of sound mind when he made the will. The outcome was favourable for Trevor; Anna Morley died and was buried 19 August 1679 and he married the widow on 23 October 1679 thus enjoying Glynde during her lifetime instead of waiting for her death before his remainder could take effect. THE TREVOR FAMILY John Trevor IV who inherited Glynde in 1679 was the head of a Welsh family with estates centring on the residences of Trevalyn in Denbigh and Plas Teg in Flint. He and his successors chose to live at Glynde and in London and he brought many of his family archives to his new home in Sussex. These archives provide many details about the Trevors and their affairs which were unknown to a recent historian of the family. The Trevors of Trevalyn were a junior branch of the Trevors of Brynkinalt in Denbigh, who claimed royal descent from Tudor Trevor, a Welsh prince of the tenth century. At first there was little to distinguish the Trevors from many other Welsh squires of ancient lineage but they had an eye to the main chance, had the good fortune to find patrons to satisfy their ambitions and by the end of the sixteenth century had risen to be one of the leading families in east Denbighshire. The history of their advance in the early years of the century is obscure. In March 1528/9 the King granted to John Trevor, yeoman of the guard, a lease for ten years of the lordships and manors of Sandeford and Osleston in the Lordship of Bramfield and Yale in Denbighshire; in 1539 the reversion of his keepership of wood in 'Le little parke' in the lordship of Chirk was granted to Geoffrey Bromefelde. This John Trevor may have been the father of the Elizabethan John Trevor III who set the family on its upward path by joining the service of Sir Richard Sackville (d. 1566 see D.N.B.), Treasurer at Wars to Henry VIII and Chancellor of the Court of Augmentations, to whom he was related by marriage. The close and friendly relationship with the Sackvilles was maintained after Sir Richard's death and in his will of 1589 John Trevor commended his children to the care of Lord Buckhurst and his heir Mr. Robert Sackville. Only the outlines of John Trevor's career are known from his funeral inscription in Gresford church: 'The years of his youth he spent abroad in the wars in France under Henry VIII; the middle years of his life he passed in travelling through foreign countries; his latter days he spent at home in the government and service of his native country.' In 'his latter days' he held two minor offices, that of particular surveyor of lands in Cheshire in the survey of the Exchequer at a salary of \u00a313 6s. 8d. granted during pleasure on 19 Aug. 1559 and Queen's attorney in the lordship in Bromfield and Yale at \u00a35 yearly in 1575. The Sackvilles evidently rewarded John Trevor with annuities from their Sussex properties; from 1563-75 he was enjoying annuities of \u00a360 from the manor of Wilmington, \u00a313 6s. 8d. from 'Wanmarshe,' and \u00a313 6s. 8d. from 'an Iron myll in Sussex that one Boyer doth occupie.' John Trevor began to build Trevalyn Hall in Allington, Denbigh, in 1576 which was completed in about 1606. John Trevor III died in 1589 leaving five sons; Randle died soon after him; the others Richard, John, Sackville and Thomas were men of ability winning knighthoods for their achievements in the army, public office, the navy and law. Richard inherited the family estates but soon ran heavily into debt, no doubt by trying to maintain 'the port, charge and countenance of a gentleman.' He tried to repair his fortunes by obtaining local offices and pressed his brother John to win favours for him from his patrons in London. Ireland offered many opportunities for the Welsh gentry in the sixteenth century and Richard distinguished himself in the Irish wars winning a knighthood from Lord Deputy Russell in 1597. His career in local politics as follower of the Earl of Essex has been treated by Professor A. H. Dodd and his part in two lurid election disputes in Denbigh in 1588 and 1601 has earned him a place in Professor J. E. Neale's The Elizabethan House of Commons. Sir Richard had no sons by his marriage with Catherine Puleston and his brother John arranged to relieve him of his financial difficulties on the assurance that his heirs would inherit the Trevor estate on Sir Richard's death. Of the two younger brothers Sir Sackville had a distinguished fighting career ending with the rank of admiral and Sir Thomas was appointed Solicitor-General to the Prince of Wales in 1619 and fourth Baron of the Exchequer in the following year. John, the second brother, was the ancestor of the Trevors of Glynde. He is a choice example of the corrupt and avaricious Jacobean courtier in an age of the lowest standards, when even the Lord Chancellor Bacon could be bribed. John began his career as secretary to Charles, Lord Howard of Effingham, afterwards Earl of Nottingham. Lord Buckhurst had married Margaret Howard, daughter of the 4th Duke of Norfolk and Professor Dodd believes that 'it may well have been through her that the next generation of the Trevors moved into the more perilous orbit of the Howards.' More perilous certainly but much more profitable. John Trevor was given the junior of the two seats for the Howard pocket borough of Bletchingley in the 1597 parliament and he shared with Nottingham's younger son Charles Howard an annuity out of the valuable farm of the sweet wines. In 1598 Nottingham as Lord High Admiral obtained John's appointment as Surveyor to the Navy, one of the five coheiress of Edmund Hampden of Wendover, Buckinghamshire. Chamberlain reports that in 1617 a marriage with the son of Sir John Packington had been arranged for this lady by her uncle Sir Alexander Hampden which 'came so neere to conclusion that all articles were agreed, and the wedding clothes made, but when yt came to the upshot, the gentlewoman had no manner of liking, nor could by any meanes be persuaded which so displeased her uncle, that he left her worse by ten thousand pound than he meant to have don, which doth no whit grieve her in respect that she hath her choice.' Her choice was Sir John Trevor II and in the draft articles of their marriage settlement it is carefully set down that the marriage had been arranged 'with the good likinge love and trewe affectione of the sayd John Trevor and Anne Hampden as they profess and acknowledge, without compulsione of their parents or friends.' John's marriage was a happy one but his sister Jane has an unsatisfactory husband, Sir Edward Fitton, bart., of Gawsworth, a drunkard and spendthrift, who was only saved from financial ruin by his brother-in-law Trevor. The main interest of Sir John Trevor II's career is why he chose to join the side of Parliament in the Civil War rather than the Crown to which he and his father had been indebted for their grants of office. After the death of the Earl of Nottingham in 1624 the Trevors had found a new patron in the Earl of Pembroke who was a leader of the opposition to the court and the Duke of Buckingham. Through his wife, Anne Hampden, Sir John was related to other opposition families, the Wenmans, Dentons and Winwoods, and by his son John's marriage with Ruth, the daughter of John Hampden 'the Patriot,' he was doubly linked with that famous family. Moreover Sir John was a Puritan by conviction as is shown by his membership of the Propagation Committee for North Wales and the protection he later gave to a Denbigh minister ejected under the Act of Uniformity. Sir John had several grievances against the Crown. He and his partners had been forced to renew their lease of the coal farm in 1639 before the old lease expired and pay a high price for the privilege. In the same year he had been required to go with the king to the North and in the next year to lend Charles \u00a31,000 and he was reluctant to do either. Finally he was deprived of his office of Surveyor of Windsor Castle. All these considerations must have prompted Sir John to support the Long Parliament in which he sat from 1640-53 as member for Grampound. He was a supporter of Cromwell to whom he was distantly related and he sat on various parliamentary committees during the Interregnum. He was an extensive buyer of land from the Treason Trustees and yet was sufficiently pliable to be an early supporter of the Restoration. principal posts in the administration, which carried a salary of \u00a340 a year and great opportunities for enrichment. Shortly after the accession of James I Trevor was knighted, probably as a favour to the Howards, who had become the leading faction of the new court. Other offices were showered on Sir John in 1603; in June he was made Steward and Receiver at Windsor Castle for life, in July, Keeper of the Fort at Upnor near Chatham, and in November, Keeper of the Palace and Park of Oatlands in Surrey. Sir John can take little credit for his activities as Surveyor of the Navy. The Commission set up by the king in 1608 to enquire into corruption in the navy reported that Sir John had abused his office by profiteering in purveyance of provisions to the king's ships, being 'the first Surveior that ever since the first erection of the Navie dealt in it.' It condemned the Surveyor, the Treasurer Sir Robert Mansell, and the Master Shipwright, Phineas Pett, for their venture with the Resistance, a ship built out of the king's stores, which sailed as a transport in the fleet carrying the embassy led by the Earl of Nottingham to conclude the peace treaty with Spain in 1605, and which made a profit of \u00a3300 from selling off naval stores to the Spaniards. Sir John thought it prudent to retire and sold his office in 1611. A more legitimate source of profit was the farm of the impositions on the coal trade which was leased to Sir John Trevor I and his three partners in January 1603/4. His papers show Sir John was an active partner and an iron chest 'capable to receave half a yeares profit' together with cash books for receipts and issues were kept at his London house in Cannon Row. He appears to have received an annual dividend of about \u00a31,500 (\u00a31,530 in 1624) but his son John who succeeded him in the partnership had some lean years during the Civil War. The Trevors were unable to renew their lease at the Restoration. Sir John had bought the Plas Teg estate near Mold, Flintshire, from his kinsman David Trevor, who was also descended from John Trevor then of Brynkinalt. Here Sir John built a mansion in the early years of the seventeenth century. He married Margaret Trevanion, daughter of Hugh Trevanion, a Cornish gentleman, whose other daughter Elizabeth married Robert Carey, afterwards Earl of Monmouth. Sir John died on 20 February 1629/30 and his widow Lady Trevor quarrelled with her eldest son John over the provision made for her in her late husband's will, but good relations were later re-established by the mediation of their friends. Sir John Trevor II was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge, 1612, and entered the Inner Temple in 1613. In 1619 he was knighted and in February of the same year he married Anne Hampden, the daughter and His son John Trevor III entered parliament in 1646 as M.P. for Flint, in 1654 he was again returned for Flint and in 1655 he was on the trade committee nominated by the Council of State. John was not a Cromwellian. He spoke in the House against the military rule of the major-generals and he argued in favour of giving the Second Chamber the name of Lords: 'We know what the House of Lords could do. We know not what this 'Other House' may do. It may claim to be the House of Commons to open the people's purse at bothe ends.' After the Restoration John Trevor was one of the group of Independents who found a patron in the Duke of Buckingham and it was through the Duke's influence that Trevor was entrusted with confidential missions to France in 1663 and 1668. In 1668 Trevor was knighted and purchased one of the two Secretaryships of State for \u00a38,000, granted only during pleasure and not for life. This should have been the peak of Trevor's achievement but in fact Sir John was little more than a cipher in office. His sympathy with the Dutch and his nonconformist leanings made Charles II unwilling to let him share in the secret diplomacy with France and he was over-shadowed by Arlington, the other Secretary of State. Whether with more freedom of action he might have revealed real ability will never be known for he died of a fever at the early age of 46. His second son Thomas made a brilliant career for himself in the law and at last brought a peerage to the family, the Barony of Trevor of Bromham in Bedfordshire, though its acquisition as one of the twelve peerages created by Queen Anne to save the Tory peace with France in 1711 made it a somewhat doubtful honour. The elder son of Sir John Trevor III, John Trevor IV, who inherited Glynde in 1679, died in 1686 and his widow Elizabeth Trevor married as her third husband, John, Lord Cutts. (Sussex Notes and Queries, vol. XIV, p. 246.) His son John Morley Trevor came of age in 1702 after a minority of 16 years, and in the same year married Lucy, the daughter of Edward Montagu of Horton, Northants. There were nine daughters of this marriage and only one son John Trevor V. While the younger branch of the Trevors, Thomas, Lord Trevor, and his sons, showed all the family characteristics of thrust and ambition, it seems as though all the ability had gone out of the elder branch of the family. John Trevor V is a melancholy illustration of this point. He was related to the all-powerful Pelhams and sat as M.P. for Lewes in 1741 in the Duke of Newcastle's interest. The Pelhams gave him a good start in life by procuring for him a Commissionership in Admiralty in 1743 which Horace Walpole noted 'is much disliked for he is of no consequence for estate, and less for parts, but is a relation of the Pelhams.' John married Betty Frankland, daughter of Sir Thomas Frankland of Thirkleby, Yorkshire, but she died in 1742 when only 25 and his tragic loss seems to have driven the young man mad. His brother-in-law, George Boscawen, then unaware of Trevor's derangement, considered 'he would never be the man he was till he had got him a wife again.' All the previous historians of the Trevor family have believed that John Trevor V died in a duel but the letters of Colonel Charles Russell in the MSS. of Mrs. Frankland Astley tell the true story. On 31 May 1743 Fanny Russell wrote to her brother Lieut.-Col. Charles Russell about Trevor that 'instead of his growing better he seems to grow worse' and she reported on 17 June that Trevor had challenged Lord Talbot to a duel on a pretended slight to Diana Frankland and two of Trevor's sisters. Lord Talbot behaved with restraint and apologised but later 'Trevor went with Dick to Headly where he did nothing but dance and sing and write challenges all day long, and frightened Dick so much that they sent for his cousin Dr. Trevor to come and take care of him.' In July the rumour spread that he had cut his throat; others thought he had been wounded in a duel. Fanny Russell wrote on 22 July 'I had a letter from Peggy Trevor the other day (who is with Mrs. Boscawen at Windsor) saying that she was very miserable about her brother who was ill of a fever.' The true story seems to be that when they got beyond Northampton he sent his sisters on in the coach, and he would follow them alone in a chaise, 'so like two great fools they left him and by and by the driver stopping to ask about the roads, found poor Trevor making wounds on himself with a pair of scissors. He prayed the coachman to kill him as he was the most miserable man on earth; however the man got help, and Dr. Trevor and Hawkins the surgeon were sent for.' Later he was reported to be much improved but on 14 August Fanny Russell wrote 'The report of poor Mr. Trevor cutting his throat was not true, but he attempted to fling himself out of the window. He is so much worse that he has been taken to Chelsea.' On 21st September Colonel Russell wrote to his wife 'Fanny has sent me a long and dismal account of poor Trevor, that he is at last happily released from his misery.' He was only 27. John Trevor V bequeathed Glynde and his Sussex estates to his kinsman Dr. Richard Trevor and his heirs while his lands in Wales were to be shared by seven of his eight sisters. The Trevor sisters contested the will, alleging that 'the testator did not make the will of sound mind' but without success. Richard Trevor, youngest son of Thomas, Lord Trevor, was the first of his family to make the church his profession, an indication that the social status of the clergy was rising by the eighteenth century. He was educated at Queen's College, Oxford; by the age of 20 he was fellow of All Souls; at 24 Doctor of Civil Law and a priest and at 27 Canon of Christ Church, Oxford. In 1744 he became Bishop of St. Davids and in 1752 he was translated to Durham. He was a great favourite with George II and seemed destined for the highest honours. He suffered two disappointments: he failed to secure election as Chancellor of Oxford University because his two opponents combined their votes against him and the greatest prize of all--Canterbury--eluded him. Horace Walpole had reported in 1758 'It is believed that St. Durham goes to Canterbury and St. Asaph follow him' but it was not to be. Walpole's 'St. Durham' was a gibe at Trevor's reputation for saintliness. Even his appearance earned him the nickname of 'the Beauty of Holiness.' He performed his duties as bishop of Durham in a manner that impressed his contemporaries, used to absentee bishops, for he lived 'all the summer months at Durham or Auckland, but chiefly the latter, where he made great improvements in the castle and park and took much exercise in walking.' It was no wonder that the preacher at his funeral said of him that 'never were the shining qualities of the Palatine more justly tempered by the milder graces of the Diocesan.' The remainder of the year Trevor spent in London or at Glynde. No single owner of Glynde Place did so much to change the appearance of the mansion or the village. He spent a great deal of his considerable income on improving Glynde Place. The entrance to the house was altered and a new range of stables built. The Bishop bought pictures and bronzes to adorn the mansion, transforming the Elizabethan country house to a charming and comfortable residence fit for a man of taste. The old Glynde church was demolished and an elegant Georgian structure erected in its place at the Bishop's expense. The establishment at Glynde revolved around the visits of the new owner, whose influence is reflected in the number of estate papers and accounts for the period 1744-71. The Bishop enlarged the estate by buying properties in Horsted Keynes and Steyning and consolidated the nucleus of the estate in Glynde and Beddingham. On the Bishop's death in 1771 his eldest brother Robert, 4th Lord Trevor, inherited the Sussex estate. Robert was educated at Queen's College, Oxford, took his B.A. in 1725 and was elected fellow of All Souls in the same year. 'He was a good scholar and a collector of drawings and prints.' Several of his Latin poems 'Britannia,' 'Lathmon' and 'Villa Bromhamensis' were published as 'Poemata Hampdeniana' by his son John at Parma in 1792. Robert had been Secretary of the Legation at the Hague from 1734-9 and minister there from 1739-46. In 1746 he resigned and was appointed a Commissioner of the Revenue in Ireland, 1759, and Joint Postmaster-General, 1759-1765, offices which show that his adherence to the Whigs did not go unrewarded. Robert's distant relative John Hampden, the last of his family, bequeathed all his Buckinghamshire estates to him and in 1776 when Robert was created a viscount he took the title of Viscount Hampden of Great and Little Hampden. According to Horace Walpole the title was obtained through the influence of Robert's son-in-law Henry, [12th] Earl of Suffolk. Robert married Constantia, the daughte of Peter Anthony de Huybert, Lord Van Kruyningen of Holland, and had two sons Thomas and John. Thomas had been M.P. for Lewes in 1768 in the Duke of Newcastle's interest. He married firstly Catherine, the daughter of General David Graeme of Braco Castle, Perth, who died in 1804, and secondly Jane Maria, daughter of George Brown of Ellistoun but had no issue by either wife. Lord Hampden and his first wife were attacked in The Female Jockey Club (1794) 'but the most serious charge against him is his having left the Whigs on the outbreak of the French Revolution, and against her that she was languid and insipid and addicted to musical parties and cardplaying.' Lady Hampden's portrait by Gainsborough hangs in the gallery at Glynde Place. Thomas died in 1824 and his brother John, who had been a diplomatist, British Minister at Munich, 1780, and at Turin, 1783-98, succeeded to the title only to die three weeks later, also without heirs. BRAND FAMILY John, 3rd Viscount Hampden, bequeathed the Glynde estate to Henry Otway Brand to whom he was remotely connected by virtue of their common ancestor Sir John Trevor III who died in 1672. Gertrude Trevor, one of the daughters of John Morley Trevor, had married the Hon. Charles Roper and their son Trevor Charles Roper succeeded in 1786 to the Barony of Dacre through his grandmother Anne, Baroness Dacre in her own right. Trevor Charles Roper, 18th Baron Dacre, married Mary Jane Fludyer but he died without issue in 1794 and his wife bequeathed the Trevor Plas Teg estate in Flint to a Roper cousin Cadwallader Blayney Roper, who took the name Trevor-Roper in 1809. Gertrude, sister of Trevor Charles Roper, became Baroness Dacre in her own right. She married Thomas Brand of the Hoo, Hertfordshire; her elder son Thomas Brand succeeded her in 1819 as 20th Baron Dacre and her younger son was the Henry Otway Brand who inherited the Glynde esta te in 1824 and who took the name of Trevor. When in 1851 Thomas, Lord Dacre, died without issue Henry Otway Trevor became 21st Baron Dacre and the Glynde estate passed to his younger son Henry Bouverie William Brand under the provision that the holder of the Barony of Dacre should always relinquish the Glynde estate in favour of the junior line. Henry Brand married Eliza, daughter of General Robert Ellice, in 1838. He first entered politics in 1846 at the age of 32 as private secretary to Sir George Grey (1799-1882 see D.N.B.) then Home Secretary in Lord John Russell's government. On 6 July 1852 he entered parliament as member for Lewes for which he sat until 1865 and for the remainder of his parliamentary career from 1868 to 1884 he was returned as member for Cambridgeshire. Brand was Lord of the Treasury under Palmerston 1855-58 and from 1859-66 parliamentary secretary to the treasury in the Liberal governments under Palmerston and Russell for which he acted as senior Liberal whip in the Commons. In 1872 he was elected Speaker of the House of Commons. 'Brand's long tenure of the position of party whip caused doubts as to his fitness for the speakership, but these were soon solved by Brand's impartial performance of his duties; he endeared himself to the House by his uniform suavity.' He held the Speakership at a critical time in parliamentary history when the rules of parliamentary procedure were being exploited for obstruction by Parnell's Irish party. Brand's most celbrated action as Speaker was his enforcement of the closure on his own responsibility after a sitting of 41 hours on a motion by W. E. Forster for leave to introduce his Coercion Bill for Ireland. Gladstone consulted the Speaker when drawing up resolutions for the reform of procedure. Brand received the G.C.B. at the close of the 1881 session and on his retirement in 1884 was created Viscount Hampden of Glynde, thus reviving the Hampden title held by his ancestors. In 1890 he succeeded his brother Thomas as 23rd Baron Dacre and his youngest son Thomas inherited Glynde. For the descent of the viscountcy see pedigree. Thomas Seymour Brand, younger brother of Lord Hampden, made the navy his career; he was flag lieutenant to Lord Alcester in 1874-7 and commanded Bittern at the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882; he retired with the rank of Rear-Admiral. (See MS. GLY/763 for the midshipman's logbook of Thomas Seymour Brand.) He married Annie Blanche, the youngest daughter of Henry Lomax Gaskell of Kiddington Hall, Woodstock, Oxfordshire. In 1916 his son Humphrey Ranulph Brand became owner of Glynde and, since his death in 1953, his widow Mrs. Brand has lived at Glynde Place.\nArrangement: FAMILY ARCHIVES Waleys Family Morley Family Early Trevor Family (pre 1679) Trevor and Brand Families GLYNDE PLACE Accounts, plans, inventories and correspondence GLYNDE CHURCH Papers concerning rebuilding MANORIAL RECORDS Relations with the Chief Lord Sussex manors Out-county manors TITLE DEEDS AND LEASES Waleys Cartulary Waleys family properties Morley family properties Trevor and Brand family properties Trevor Welsh estate Various Evidences ESTATE PAPERS: SUSSEX Purchases and sales Correspondence Rentals Accounts Tenancy Agreements Terriers, Valuations and Surveys Maps and Plans Enclosure Turnpike Act Timber Records Stewards' Papers Miscellaneous ESTATE PAPERS: BEDFORDSHIRE ESTATE PAPERS: BUCKINGHAMSHIRE ESTATE PAPERS: WALES ECCLESIASTICAL AND PARISH RECORDS Rectories of Glynde and Beddingham Glynde Parish Records Charities Schools MISCELLANEA Pedigree of Anglo-Saxon kings John of Gaunt's Household rolls Other Miscellaneous Records MAPS AND PLANS\nNote: ABBREVIATIONS Cal.
