# Dataset overview

## Historical background

In the 1860s photography as a medium and industry was coming under scrutiny due to its rapid development. Issues of ownership and copyright were becoming impossible to ignore and so debates ensued around how photography should be defined and protected under the law. This culminated in the 1862 Fine Arts Copyright Act, which in turn required the registration of photographs, paintings and drawings with the Stationers’ Company, a system which continued for almost 50 years. 
Those registering a work were instructed to enter a description of the work being registered, along with the name and place of abode of the copyright owner (or proprietor of copyright) and the name and place of abode of the copyright author (the artist or photographer). The forms were then dated and signed by the owner and in many cases a copy of the work (in the form or a print or sketch) was attached to the form.
These registration forms and attached artwork, along with related registers and indexes were eventually transferred to the Public Record Office, now The National Archives (TNA). This collection (COPY 1) now comprises potentially over 400,000 individual entry forms.

## The metadata dataset

The individual entry forms registering photographs (COPY 1 – Photographs) have been fully transcribed and catalogued by volunteers and metadata is openly available and downloadable from TNA’s online catalogue Discovery. The metadata includes each document classification and the full transcription of the description of the photograph, as well as the key stakeholders (copyright depositor and owner) and the location of the registration. However these are conflated in the “Description” field, making the downloaded metadata only semi-structured.
